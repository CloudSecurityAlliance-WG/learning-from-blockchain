The hot wallet and multi-signature treasury of Remilia's parent company, Remilia, were hacked, with assets from multiple official Remilia wallets being transferred and sold. Charlotte Fang, the founder of Milady, claimed he was hacked and drained of ETH and NFTs potentially worth several million dollars. Although the project's treasury used a multi-signature model, the private keys were stored in one password manager, which Fang says was compromised. The attacker stole around 490 ETH (~$1.8 million) and $58,000 USDC, along with more than 130 Milady NFTs, 320 Remilio NFTs, and hundreds of derivative tokens issued on the NFTX platform. Based on floor prices, the assets are valued at north of $6 million.</p>
