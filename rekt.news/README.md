wget -x -i urls.txt

extract-content.py on each index.html > extracted.html
remove-signup.sh

then extract all URLs:
sed 's/"/\n/g' extracted.html  | grep ^http

then get all the URLs with content_downloader.py from AI-Prompting and extract text

Bundle the data together... URL, content, etc. As for a summary?

## Questions

* How much do the two datasets overlap
* Values per hack, any recovery if possible
* Ransomware payments - see if any got returned/used to arrest the gang/etc.
* Root causes/contributing factors like flash loans or bridges to exfiltrate the funds
* Clustering of data and the incidents where possible
* Losses total by category
* Value of loss at time, and value of loss "currently"? % of coins stolen as well?
