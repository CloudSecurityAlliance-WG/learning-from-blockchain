Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, there is not enough information to conclusively determine how the attacker gained access to Poloniex's funds. 

The article notes that exchange hacks often involve "off-chain attack vectors" like phishing to gain access to private keys or insider access. However, no specific details are given about the methods used in this case.

The article tracks the movement of funds from Poloniex's wallets to the attacker's wallets, but does not provide information about how the attacker gained access to make these unauthorized withdrawals in the first place.

So in summary:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."

The article focuses more on tracking the stolen funds on-chain rather than detailing how access was initially gained to perpetrate the attack. More investigation seems to be required to determine the exact attack vector used against Poloniex.
