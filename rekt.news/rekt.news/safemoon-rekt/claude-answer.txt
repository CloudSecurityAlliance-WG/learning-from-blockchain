Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was that the new Safemoon contract code left the burn() function publicly callable. This allowed anyone to burn SFM tokens from any address. The attacker exploited this by burning a large number of SFM tokens that were held in the SFM:BNB liquidity pool. This caused the price of SFM in the pool to become highly inflated. The attacker then sold SFM tokens (that they already owned) into the skewed pool and drained it of 28k BNB, worth $8.9 million.

The key factors that enabled the attack were:

1) The burn() function being left public instead of restricting access to authorized addresses
2) The attacker having a supply of SFM tokens that they could sell into the manipulated pool 
3) The pool containing a significant amount of BNB liquidity that could be drained

The attack took advantage of a coding vulnerability introduced in a contract upgrade. By manipulating token balances, the attacker was able to extract nearly $9 million worth of value from the pool.
