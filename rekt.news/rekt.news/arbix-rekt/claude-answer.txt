Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no clear technical details about how the attack was executed. The write-up states that the project "drained the vaults of users' funds", but does not provide specifics on how this was done from a technical perspective.

Some key points:

- The project deleted their website, Twitter, and Telegram, indicating it was likely an insider attack/rug pull rather than an external hack.

- Funds were drained directly from the vaults and sent to an address controlled by the attackers. But there are no technical details provided on how access to the vaults was obtained.

- 4.5M ARBX tokens were minted and sold off, tanking the price. This indicates possible access to minting capabilities.

- Funds were bridged from BSC to Ethereum and converted to ETH by the attackers.

Overall there is simply not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness exploited. It appears funds were accessed in an unauthorized way, but the exact attack vector is unclear. For example, there's no mention of a smart contract exploit. At most all we can determine is it was likely an insider rug pull rather than an external attack. So at this point I would have to conclude there is not enough information to determine how the attack took place from a technical perspective. Please let me know if any additional details from the write-up could aid analysis.
