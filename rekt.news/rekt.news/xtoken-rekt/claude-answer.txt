Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to conclusively determine how the attack was executed. 

The key pieces of information provided are:

- The attacker used a flash loan from DyDx for 61,833 ETH (~$267M)
- They used a private transaction facilitated by Flashbots MEV
- They were somehow able to mint a massive amount of xSNXa tokens for a very small amount of ETH
- They swapped tokens in various DEXes (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Balancer) to extract value
- In total around $24 million was drained from the xSNXa and xBNTa pools

However, the exact vulnerability or sequence of transactions that allowed them to mint so many xTokens is not shown. 

The write-up speculates that there may have been a price oracle manipulation due to buying/selling tokens on DEXes like Uniswap. But without the specific transactions, it's impossible to say for sure.

So in summary - there is not enough information provided in this write-up to conclusively determine the exact vulnerability utilized in the attack. More specific transaction data and details on the minting process would be needed.
