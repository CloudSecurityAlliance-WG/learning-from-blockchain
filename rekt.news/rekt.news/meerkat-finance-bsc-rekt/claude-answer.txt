Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the upgradeability mechanism used by the Meerkat Finance vault contracts. Specifically:

1. The Meerkat Finance deployer upgraded the vault contracts to a malicious implementation that had a backdoor init() function. This function allowed anyone to set themselves as the vault owner.

2. The attacker called the init() function to make themselves the owner of the vaults. 

3. The malicious vault implementation also contained a drain() function that could be called by the vault owner to steal all the funds. 

4. The attacker, now set as the vault owner, called the drain() function on both vaults to steal the BUSD and WBNB.

So in summary, the vulnerability was the unrestricted upgradeability of the vault contracts, which allowed the deployer to point them to a malicious implementation and for the attacker to then backdoor their way into ownership and drain the funds.

There are enough technical details provided to determine how the attack took place. The attacker used an upgradeability and access control vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and steal funds from the vaults.
