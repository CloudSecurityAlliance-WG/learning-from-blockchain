Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the withdraw() functions of the 7 malicious Strategy contracts that were added to the codebase after the initial audit.

Specifically:

1. The attacker deployed 7 malicious Strategy contracts with manipulated withdraw() functions that lacked checks to prevent unauthorized withdrawals. 

2. Through the Controller contract, the attacker set and approved these 7 malicious Strategies.

3. The attacker then called the inCaseStrategyTokenGetStuck() function on the Controller contract. This abused the lack of checks in the malicious Strategies' withdraw() functions to transfer tokens from those Strategies into the Controller contract.

4. Finally, the attacker called the inCaseTokensGetStuck() function on the Controller to transfer the tokens into their own wallet, rug pulling the funds.

So in summary, the vulnerability was the ability for the attacker to deploy malicious contract logic with insufficient security checks after the initial audit, allowing them to bypass authorization and withdraw user funds into their own account. The key weakness that enabled this was the centralized control/upgradability that the developer retained over critical contract components.

Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
