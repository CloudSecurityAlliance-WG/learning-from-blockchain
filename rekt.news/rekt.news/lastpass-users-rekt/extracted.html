Successful rescue missions are COMMON.</p></blockquote><p>Funds are eventually sent to a CEX such as “<em>FixedFloat, SimpleSwap, SideShift, ChangeNOW, LetsExchange</em>”.</p><p><strong>The hackers also seem to <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1648187055871250433">favour</a> the weekends.</strong></p><p><em>Over $37M stolen and still working a day job?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p>While initial comms from LastPass in August 2022 made it seem that there was no reason to worry, any user who then let their guard down may later have become a victim.</p><p>Though there may be <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1712286478532038752">good reason</a> to be guarded with info sharing, the safest option for users is always to rotate assets to a fresh seed phrase if in any doubt.</p><p><strong>Improved UX is not worth trusting sensitive info to 3rd parties.</strong></p><p><em>When did you last change your seed?</em>
