Since then, aside from downplaying the incident (“<em>less than 1% of our monthly active users have been affected/reported</em>”), the team have not stated what caused the hack.</p><p><em>Do they even know <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1668778037083791361">themselves</a>?</em></p><p>The hack reportedly affected both desktop and mobile users, whose addresses were targeted on <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665151915355676674">13 chains</a>.</p><p>The addresses were drained via a three step <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1665069321255788544">system</a>. Firstly, a direct transfer into a new address, where tokens were then swapped for the chain’s native asset and consolidated in a third wallet.</p><p>Tracing the funds (spearheaded by <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/">ZachXBT</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_">Tayvano</a>) looks to have been a painstaking task, relying on individual user reports, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1665746407834124290">linking</a> the above process to addresses which provided gas to the accounts in question.</p><p>Some funds ($1M) have apparently been <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665226056570118146">recovered</a>, but the method is being kept quiet for now. And while some spend time helping victims, others look to <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1665121672918179840">capitalise</a> on their desperation with a fake ‘refund’ airdrop.</p><p><em>The <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1668935289614790656">laundering</a> of funds has shown patterns <a href="https://hub.elliptic.co/analysis/35-million-atomic-wallet-hacker-funnels-crypto-to-north-korea-s-favored-mixer/">attributed</a> to the Lazarus Group, being sent to the Sinbad BTC mixer (formerly Blender), a DPRK favourite.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>While the root cause is still to be identified, the hack may be <a href="https://twitter.com/IM_23pds/status/1668886220435509249">linked</a> to a <a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/tip/How-does-BGP-hijacking-work-and-what-are-the-risks">BGP hijacking</a> of Atomic Wallet traffic.</strong></p><p>BGP has <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1668936939704307712">played a part</a> in a number of crypto incidents in the past. While this technique is <a href="https://twitter.com/TalBeerySec/status/1668948073026928640">not enough</a> on its own to carry out the heist, it may have been combined with the vulnerabilities alluded to (though never specifically disclosed) by Least Authority, who faced <a href="https://twitter.com/zooko/status/1668714413220851713">legal pressure</a> to take down their blog post.</p><p>A <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1665192130539823106">leak of logged</a> sensitive data, such as was the case with the <a href="https://rekt.news/unsolved-mystery/">Slope wallet</a> incident on Solana, is another possiblity.
