Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no clear technical details given about the specific vulnerability or attack vector used to compromise Atomic Wallet. 

The article mentions several possibilities that have been raised by security researchers:

- Vulnerabilities reported to Atomic Wallet in 2021 by auditors Least Authority, which were never fixed. No specifics are provided about these vulnerabilities.

- A BGP hijacking attack that may have intercepted and logged Atomic Wallet traffic. This alone would not have enabled the thefts, but could have been combined with other vulnerabilities. No confirmation is provided.

- A data leak similar to the Slope wallet incident, but again no confirmation.

Without more technical information from Atomic Wallet about the root cause, the article states that it's difficult for other wallet providers to check if they are vulnerable to the same attack. 

The article also criticizes Atomic's poor security posture and refusal to engage with researchers who have reported issues to them.

In summary, the information provided does not contain enough specific technical details to determine precisely how the attacks took place. As the article states, the root cause is still unknown. The key phrase that sums this up is: "While the root cause is still to be identified..."
