Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Autoshark protocol's reward minting mechanism. Specifically:

1. The attacker made a small deposit into the SHARK-BNB vault to establish a position. 

2. They took out a large (100K BNB) flash loan from Pancakeswap.

3. They used 50K BNB from the flash loan to buy SHARK tokens, and sent the SHARK + remaining 50K BNB to the SharkMinter contract.

4. They called the getReward function on the SharkMinter contract with their deposit from step 1.

5. Because the SharkMinter contract saw a huge SHARK and BNB balance (from step 3), it incorrectly calculated an extremely large profit amount and minted 100M new SHARK tokens as a reward. 

6. The attacker dumped the minted SHARK tokens to repay the flash loan.

In summary, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to artificially inflate the reward calculation by sending assets directly to the minter contract to manipulate its balance. This resulted in an excessive number of new SHARK tokens being minted as reward. There are enough technical details provided to determine the attack vector.
