Message:  Based on the details provided in the text, there is not enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place that allowed the unauthorized transfer of $477 million from FTX. 

The text mentions that the $477 million in unauthorized transfers was potentially due to:

1) A hack by an "ex-employee" or malware on an ex-employee's computer

2) Instructions by Bahamian authorities to drain FTX wallets

However, there are no technical details provided on exactly how the unauthorized access occurred in either scenario. 

The text also states that the reason behind the removal of the $633 million from FTX on November 12th (of which the $477 million was part of) remains one of the most pressing unanswered questions.

So in summary, while the text speculates on some potential attack vectors like an insider attack or instructions from authorities, there is simply not enough technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that was exploited to enable the unauthorized transfers. The key phrase that sums this up is: 

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."
