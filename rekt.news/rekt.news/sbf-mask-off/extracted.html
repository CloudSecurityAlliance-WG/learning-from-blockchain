Ray III had some strong words about SBF’s management abilities:</p><blockquote><p>Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and such a complete absence of trustworthy financial information as occurred here. From compromised systems integrity and faulty regulatory oversight abroad, to the concentration of control in the hands of a very small group of inexperienced, unsophisticated and potentially compromised individuals, this situation is unprecedented.</p></blockquote><p><strong>…and coming from the man who oversaw the aftermath of Enron, that’s saying a lot.</strong></p><p>The documents also provide a look into the dire state of SBF’s empire with highlights including:</p><ul><li><p>The value of “Crypto Assets Held at Fair Value” by FTX.com is estimated at just $659k, rather than SBF’s previous claim of ~$5B (of “semi-liquid” shitcoins).</p></li><li><p>Loans totalling $3.3B from Alameda to SBF and his Paper Bird Inc.</p></li><li><p>The statement that “corporate funds of the FTX Group were used to purchase homes and other personal items for employees”.</p></li><li><p>FTX and Alameda “do not have an accounting department”</p></li></ul><p>Plus the following description of their operational practices:</p><blockquote><p>Unacceptable management practices included the use of an unsecured group email account as the root user to access confidential private keys and critically sensitive data for the FTX Group companies around the world, the absence of daily reconciliation of positions on the blockchain, the use of software to conceal the misuse of customer funds, the secret exemption of Alameda from certain aspects of FTX.com’s auto-liquidation protocol, and the absence of independent governance as between Alameda [and FTX.com].</p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p>Despite SBFs interviews, “leaked” DMs,, and his continued presence on Twitter, many questions remain unanswered.</p><p>The reason behind the removal of $633M from FTX on the 12th of November is perhaps the most pressing.</p><p>$477M of this amount was apparently due to “<a href="https://twitter.com/_Ryne_Miller/status/1591495429338071042"><em>unauthorized access</em></a>”, with FTX staff sending the remainder to a <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x97f991971a37D4Ca58064e6a98FC563F03A71E5c">secure multisig</a> pending bankruptcy proceedings.</p><p><strong>While SBF’s leaked DMs chalk it up to a hack by an “ex-employee, or malware on an ex-employee’s computer”, Bahamian authorities <a href="https://twitter.com/SCBgov_bs/status/1593395137786171393">claim to have instructed</a> the draining of FTX wallets.
