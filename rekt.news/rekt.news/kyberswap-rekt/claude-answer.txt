Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in KyberSwap Elastic's concentrated liquidity pools. Specifically:

1. The attacker used flash loans to manipulate asset prices and push them into regions of the liquidity pools that had little or no liquidity.

2. By executing extremely precise swaps within these low/no liquidity regions, the attacker was able to trick the smart contracts due to a precision error in the code. 

3. This allowed the attacker to artificially increase their liquidity share in the pools through "double liquidity counting". 

4. Having inflated their share of the pool liquidity, the attacker was then able to drain a significant portion of funds from the pools across multiple chains.

The key vulnerabilities stemmed from the ability to manipulate prices/ticks within the concentrated liquidity pools via flash loans, and the precision error that enabled double liquidity counting. Together, these vulnerabilities allowed the loss of over $48 million across six different blockchains.

The attack does not seem characteristic of the Lazarus hacking group based on the performative messages left by the hacker. While the attacker did send funds to a previous Lazarus victim, this could be an attempt at misdirection. Overall there is not enough evidence to conclusively attribute this attack to Lazarus or any other specific entity.
