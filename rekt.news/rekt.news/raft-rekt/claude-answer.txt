Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability that allowed them to inflate the value of collateral in Raft's system. Specifically:

- The attacker opened positions and provided collateral to mint R stablecoins. 

- They then liquidated those positions from another address that held excess ETH, likely obtained via a flash loan. This overvalued the collateral from the liquidated positions.

- With the inflated collateral values, the attacker was able to mint a large amount (6.7M) of new R stablecoins.

- They attempted to dump and sell these stablecoins for a profit, but failed to actually collect the profits due to a bug that sent the ETH to the burn address instead of the attacker's address.

So in summary, the key vulnerability was the ability to artificially inflate collateral values by liquidating positions with value sourced from elsewhere. This allowed the minting of unbacked stablecoins. The technical breakdowns provided in the various Twitter threads linked in the article give more specifics on how this was executed.
