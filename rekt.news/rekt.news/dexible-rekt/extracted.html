Dexible’s post-mortem report (published via Telegram and Discord, in PDF format) explains:</p><blockquote><p>embedded in each request to swap was a "route" of what DEX to call and what data to send to that DEX to execute a swap</p></blockquote><p>However, the function does not check whether the router address is actually a DEX by, for example, using an on-chain allowlist:</p><blockquote><p>the router address was not verified on-chain in any way. This meant that instead of calling a DEX smart contract, the hacker simply called a token contract with a request to "transferFrom" any account that had spend approval on the Dexible contract</p></blockquote><p>Attacker addresses (<a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x684083f312ac50f538cc4b634d85a2feafaab77a">ETH</a>, <a href="https://arbiscan.io/address/0x684083f312ac50f538cc4b634d85a2feafaab77a">ARBI</a>, <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x684083f312ac50f538cc4b634d85a2feafaab77a#tokentxns">BSC</a>): <strong>0x684083f312ac50f538cc4b634d85a2feafaab77a</strong></p><p>Example tx: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x138daa4cbeaa3db42eefcec26e234fc2c89a4aa17d6b1870fc460b2856fd11a6">0x138daa4c…</a></p><p>Relatively <a href="https://twitter.com/DexibleApp/status/1626592861050527745">few addresses</a> were affected, with the majority of losses <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/02/17/blocktower-capital-loses-15m-in-defi-market-aggregator-dexible-exploit-blockchain-data/">reportedly</a> coming from an <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x58f5f0684c381fcfc203d77b2bba468ebb29b098">address</a> belonging to <a href="https://www.blocktower.com/">BlockTower Capital</a> which lost 18M TRU tokens, valued at ~$1.4M at the time.</p><p>In total, approximately $1.5M was lost on Ethereum, and sent to Tornado Cash.

We had several community members and Dexible engineers review the code, and they did not find the vulnerability. The core engineer that created the contracts has over 25 years of software engineering experience, and he did not see the vulnerability. Upon reviewing one of the hacker's transactions, however, he immediately understood how it was executed.</p></blockquote><p><strong>An audit is not a silver bullet… but it certainly helps.</strong></p><p>Even the most experienced engineers may overlook a security vulnerability in their own code. Naturally, when building a new protocol, devs primarily have users in mind.</p><p>But in this industry, security is paramount.</p><p><em>And no shortage of unaudited protocols have made it onto the <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>.</em></p><p><strong>In Dexible’s own words:</strong></p><blockquote><p>exploits happen in DeFi.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
