Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to steal funds from Dexible was an lack of input validation in the selfSwap function. Specifically:

- The selfSwap function allows users to define custom routing for swaps by specifying a "router address" and data to send to that address.

- However, the contract did not verify that the router address was actually a DEX contract. 

- The attacker exploited this by specifying a token contract address as the router, and crafting the data to call the transferFrom function to steal tokens.

So in summary, the vulnerability was:

1. selfSwap allows custom router without verifying it is a DEX
2. Attacker provided token contract address as router 
3. Attacker crafted data to call transferFrom on token contract to steal funds

This allowed the attacker to bypass the expected swap behavior and directly steal tokens from Dexible. Performing input validation on the router address by checking it against an allowlist of DEX contracts could have prevented this attack.
