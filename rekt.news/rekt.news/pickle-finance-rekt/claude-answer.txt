Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to definitively determine how the attack took place. 

The key details that would be needed are:

1) What specifically was the vulnerability in the Pickle Finance contracts that allowed the attacker to create a "fake" Pickle Jar and drain funds from the real Pickle Jar? This is not clearly explained.

2) How did the attacker actually exploit this vulnerability at a technical level? What transactions did they send, and how did that allow them to drain the funds?

The write-up mentions that:

- There was no whitelist for which Jars could use the swapping function
- The swapExactJarForJar function did not check for "whitelisted" jars
- The attacker created a fake Pickle Jar and used the swapping function to drain funds

But the specifics of how they created this fake Jar, connected it to the system, and executed the exploit through transactions are not provided.

So in summary, while it seems there was likely some vulnerability in the Pickle Finance contracts related to a lack of whitelists/checks around Jars, the post does not contain enough technical details to determine exactly how the attack flowed and transactions were structured. But I wanted to provide that feedback rather than just saying there is not enough information, in case some parts of the attack vector could be inferred or guessed from the limited info provided. Please let me know if any additional details would be helpful!
