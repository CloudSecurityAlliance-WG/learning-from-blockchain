Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the provided text to conclusively determine how the attack on Kokomo Finance took place. 

The key information provided is:

1) The deployer address of KOKO Token (0x41BE) deployed an attack contract cBTC and made some malicious configuration changes like setting reward speed, pausing borrow, and setting a malicious implementation contract.

2) Another address (0x5a2d) approved the cBTC contract to spend wrapped BTC that was deposited.

3) The attacker called a method on the malicious cBTC implementation contract to transfer the wrapped BTC to their own address (0x5C8d).

4) The attacker swapped the stolen wrapped BTC to 141 regular BTC for a profit of around $4 million.

However, there are not enough code or configuration details provided to determine exactly how the changes made by the deployer address allowed the theft of funds. The text mentions "changes" and a "malicious implementation contract" but does not provide specifics on what those changes or malicious logic was.

So in summary - an attacker manipulated the Kokomo Finance contracts in an undisclosed way to steal user funds, but further details would be needed to determine the precise vulnerability. The provided information points to access/control issues with the deployer address and funds being moved in unauthorized ways, but does not give the specifics of how the attack transactions worked from a technical level.
