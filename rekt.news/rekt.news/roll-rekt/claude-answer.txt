Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attack on Roll took place. 

The write-up speculates about possible attack vectors, stating:

>"Igor Igamberdiev states that this attack was a possible private key compromise or inside job"

However, there are no confirmed details provided about the specific vulnerability or attack method used. 

The write-up does make clear that:

- $5.7 million in funds were stolen from Roll's hot wallet
- The hacker immediately dumped the stolen social tokens for ETH
- There has been no public response or statement from the Roll team about the attack

But without further technical information from the Roll team itself, it is impossible to conclusively state how the attack occurred or what vulnerability was exploited.

The lack of details makes it unclear if this was due to an insider threat, a private key compromise, a smart contract vulnerability, or something else. 

So in summary - the write-up does not contain enough specific technical information to determine the exact method used in the attack on Roll. The phrase "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place" accurately reflects the lack of technical details about the attack vector, vulnerability, or method provided in this incident description.
