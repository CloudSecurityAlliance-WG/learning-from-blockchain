Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute this attack. 

The key details that are missing are:

1. The source code of the relevant Qubit Finance smart contracts that were exploited. Without seeing the actual code, it's impossible to pinpoint the specific vulnerability.

2. More technical specifics on how the attacker was able to deposit 77,162 qXETH without actually locking any ETH on Ethereum. The post-mortem gives a high-level overview but does not provide the implementation details that would show the vulnerability.

3. More information about the audit report referenced. It's mentioned that the cross-chain collateral feature was audited, but without seeing the actual audit to understand what was covered and any issues raised, it's difficult to assess where the process broke down.

The post-mortem hints at some kind of logic vulnerability related to the tokenAddress variable in the QBridgeHandler contract and the safeTransferFrom function. But the exact details are not provided to determine if it was an authentication issue, access control issue, integer overflow, reentrancy, etc.

So in summary, while it seems there was likely a serious smart contract vulnerability that was exploited, there is simply not enough technical information provided here to explain exactly how the attack occurred from a code perspective. Please let me know if any additional details can be provided.
