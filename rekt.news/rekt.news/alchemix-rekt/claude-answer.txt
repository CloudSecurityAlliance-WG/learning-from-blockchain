Message:  Based on the information provided, there are not enough technical details to determine exactly how the attack on Alchemix took place. 

The key information provided is:

- Alchemix allowed users to deposit ETH and take out a loan in alETH (representing the future yield)
- Some users discovered the protocol assigned them no debt when doing this
- These users were able to withdraw their original ETH collateral while still holding the alETH they minted

So there was clearly some kind of vulnerability that allowed users to mint alETH without taking on debt, resulting in free alETH. 

However, the post-mortem does not provide technical specifics on how this occurred from a coding/smart contract perspective. 

Without more technical implementation details, I cannot determine the exact vulnerability or weakness that was exploited. The post focuses more on the aftermath and response rather than the root cause details.

So in summary - there is not enough information provided here to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that enabled attackers to execute this "reverse rugpull." More technical smart contract and implementation details would be needed.
