<strong>We hit a new low. A blue-chip rekt by a front-end attack.</strong></p><p>A developer who had been contracted to work on the MISO auction for <em>“JayPegs Automart”</em> inserted his own wallet address into the contract instead of the <strong>auctionWallet</strong>.</p><p><strong>Remind us, which part of crypto is supposed to be “trustless”?</strong></p><p><em>Misplaced faith cost MISO $3.1 million.</em></p><p><em>The aftermath was more aggressive than usual.</em></p><p>In a since deleted tweet, Sushi CTO <a href="https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1438712356352274433?s=20">Joseph DeLong went public</a> with his suspicions, doxxing the developer he believed to be responsible.</p><blockquote><p>The Miso front end has become the victim of a supply chain attack. An anonymous contractor by with the GH handle AristoK3 injected malicious code into the Miso front end. We have reason to believe this is <a href="https://twitter.com/eratos1122">@eratos1122</a>.</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/eratos1122/status/1438868691857420293?s=20">Eratos1122 protested</a>, but the Sushi team had made their case, and they refused to back down.</p><p>DeLong had attached the resume, personal website, Facebook profile, email address and invoice details of eratos1122 into a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L2M_-rWcnGcX65nL24UydzC7DrUfT_g0AZxNlQVUJ-c/edit">public Google doc.</a></p><p>After a few hours of these details being made public, and following threats from the Sushi team to involve the FBI, the money was returned.

<strong>When whitehat developers switch hats to black, they often forget to cover their tracks.</strong></p><p>Doxxing somebody like that is a serious step to take, and the Sushi team / Joseph DeLong must have had a lot of conviction in order to be so public with their accusation.</p><p>The tweets and documents may no longer be available, but the Sushi and Jaypeg team still seem confident that their suspicions were correct.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/jaypeg-miso.png"/></figure>
