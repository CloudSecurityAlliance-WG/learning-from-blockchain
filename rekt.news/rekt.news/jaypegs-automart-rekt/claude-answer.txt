Message:  Unfortunately, there are not enough technical details provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attacker compromised the MISO auction contract. 

The key sentence is: "A developer who had been contracted to work on the MISO auction for _“JayPegs Automart”_ inserted his own wallet address into the contract instead of the **auctionWallet**."

This indicates that an insider - a developer who had access to and was working on the smart contract code - maliciously modified the contract to direct funds to his own wallet rather than the intended auction wallet. 

However, without seeing the actual contract code and specifics on how it was modified, I cannot explain the precise vulnerability or exploit that was used. 

The write-up does not provide the necessary level of technical detail about the code, contract, or changes made to determine the specific attack vector. It appears to be intentionally vague, likely because the details were not made public or remain uncertain.

In summary, while an insider attack against the contract is described, there is not enough information provided to determine the specific technique used or vulnerability exploited to carry out the attack. Please let me know if any additional detail becomes available that could shed light on the technical nature of this incident.
