Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to drain the funds from Team Finance. 

The key details that are missing are:

1) The source code of the vulnerable migrate() function that was exploited. Without seeing the actual code, it's impossible to analyze the specific vulnerability.

2) Details on how the attacker was able to bypass the "authorized sender check" mentioned by Peckshield. This seems to be a key part of how the exploit worked but there are no further details provided. 

3) More specifics on how the attacker was able to manipulate/skew prices in the migration from Uniswap V2 to V3 pairs. Again, this is called out as allowing the attacker to get "huge leftover" funds but the exact mechanism is not explained.

So in summary, while the write-up provides a high-level overview of the incident, there is simply not enough technical information about the inner workings of the vulnerable code or specifics of how the attacker crafted the exploit transactions to determine the root cause vulnerability. Without source code and transaction specifics to analyze, it is difficult to ascertain anything more about the weakness beyond speculation.
