Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to exploit Exactly Protocol was an insufficient check in the DebtManager contract regarding whether the market address passed was valid. 

Specifically, the DebtManager contract did not properly verify that the market address passed to it was a valid market. This allowed the attacker to pass a fake market address, while inserting the victim's address as _msgSender. This resulted in users' collateral being drained.

The key pieces of information that reveal this are:

1) "The attack was made possible due to an insufficient check in the DebtManager contract ([proxy](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x675d410dcf6f343219AAe8d1DDE0BFAB46f52106), [implementation](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x16748Cb753A68329cA2117a7647aA590317EbF41#code)) as to whether the market address was valid."

2) "This allowed the hacker to pass a fake market address, inserting the victim’s address as _msgSender, and thereby drain users’ collateral."

3) The provided code snippet showing the vulnerability in the DebtManager contract.

So in summary, the attack worked by exploiting insufficient validation of the market address parameter, allowing the attacker to manipulate it and drain collateral to their own address. The technical details provided make this clear.
