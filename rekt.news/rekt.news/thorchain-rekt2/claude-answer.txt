Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack. 

The write-up mentions that the attacker targeted the Thorchain Bifrost component through the ETH Router contract, and provides the contract addresses involved. It shows the series of transactions the attacker made, emitting fake deposit events and tricking the router into forwarding ETH to a fake Asgard vault address controlled by the attacker. This allowed the attacker to steal funds.

However, the technical details of how the attacker was able to spoof these fake deposit events and trick the router contract are not provided. The write-up states it was due to "Lack of proper multi-event handling" but does not elaborate on the specifics of the vulnerability. 

The write-up also mentions a secondary vulnerability due to the use of tx.origin instead of msg.sender in the RUNE token contract, allowing interactions with malicious contracts to steal RUNE. But again, the exact details of how this was exploited are not provided.

So in summary, while the write-up provides some helpful context around the incidents, there is not enough technical information provided to determine the precise vulnerabilities and how they were exploited by the attacker. More details would be needed to explain that.
