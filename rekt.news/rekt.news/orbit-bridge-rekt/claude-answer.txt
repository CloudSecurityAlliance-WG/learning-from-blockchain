Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, it seems the attack vector was not conclusively disclosed. The article states:

"While the hack is initially assumed to be due to compromised keys of signer-addresses on the Orbitâ€™s ETH Vault multisig, the team is yet to disclose the exact nature of the attack vector."

It mentions some possibilities, like a transaction replay attack similar to an issue identified in a past audit, but ultimately says:

"NOTE: This article will be updated to include the root cause once an official post-mortem has been published."

So there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to definitively determine how the attack took place. The article is awaiting an official post-mortem report from Orbit Chain to disclose those details.
