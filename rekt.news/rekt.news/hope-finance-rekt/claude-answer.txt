Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the Hope Finance smart contracts to drain funds from the GenesisRewardPool contract.

Specifically:

1. A fake router contract was deployed. 

2. The SwapHelper contract was then updated to use this fake router. This transaction was signed by all 3 owners of the Hope Finance multisig wallet, suggesting they were complicit.

3. The `_swapExactTokensForTokens` variable in the SwapHelper was set to the attacker's wallet address. 

4. When `GenesisRewardPool.openTrade()` was called, instead of swapping WETH for USDC as intended, the USDC and WETH were sent directly to the attacker's wallet address.

5. The attacker then bridged the stolen ETH to Ethereum mainnet and deposited it into Tornado Cash.

So in summary, the attack exploited the SwapHelper contract by directing swaps to send funds to the attacker's wallet address instead of performing the token swaps. The involvement of the multisig owners suggests this may have been an inside job or "rug pull."
