Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The key pieces of information provided are:

- The attacker was able to exploit a Factory contract on the Ethereum network to mint tokens directly into different addresses. 

- The attack involved calling the receive function on the Factory contract and dodging an authentication check using a new address signature for each transaction.

- A charge fee of 0.005 ETH was paid for each minting transaction.  

- The minted tokens were then bridged to BSC and sold for WBNB.

However, without more specifics on the vulnerable contract code, how the authentication check was bypassed, or the precise minting and bridging mechanisms used, I cannot reliably describe the full technical details behind the attack vector.

In summary: "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place." More technical specifics would be needed to analyze the vulnerability. Please let me know if any additional attack details become available!
