Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no technical details about how the attacker gained access to Deribit's hot wallets or compromised the private keys. The post simply states that funds were taken from Deribit's hot wallets on Ethereum and Bitcoin, and provides the attacker's receiving addresses where the stolen funds were sent.

The post speculates that it could have been due to a phishing attack that compromised employee credentials or private keys, but there is no evidence provided to confirm that. Phishing is a common vector for these types of attacks.

Without more technical information or confirmation from Deribit on how the attack took place, there is not enough information to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that was exploited. The key phrase that sums this up is:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."

If more details emerge later on the root cause or method used by the attacker, then a more definitive assessment could be provided. But based on the currently available information in the post, there are no confirmed technical details about the specific attack vector.
