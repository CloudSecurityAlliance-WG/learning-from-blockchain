Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the Revest Finance ERC1155 minting contract. Here is a summary of how the attack took place:

1. The attacker opened a position with depositAmount=0 and quantities=[2] tokens, so no funds were deposited. This created an FNFT with id=1027.

2. The attacker opened another position with depositAmount=0 and quantities=360,000 tokens, again depositing no funds but receiving 360,000 worthless tokens with fnftId=1028. 

3. When the FNFTHandler mint function executed, the attacker re-entered the Revest contract via onERC1155Received. They called depositAdditionalToFNFT with amount=1e18, quantities=1, fnftId=1027. This would normally create a new position with fnftId=1029, but due to the delay in updating fnftId, it overwritten position 1028 instead.

4. This assigned value to the 360,000 tokens with fnftId=1028 owned by the attacker. They withdrew those tokens worth 1e18 * 360,000 after only depositing 1e18 funds.

So in summary, the reentrancy exploit allowed the attacker to deposit additional funds to position 1028 instead of creating position 1029 due to the fnftId not being updated in time. This ascribed huge value to their previously worthless tokens in position 1028 which they proceeded to drain.
