Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability or weakness the attacker used was:

A bZx developer was sent a phishing email with a malicious Word document macro that when opened, compromised the private keys to the developer's personal wallet. This wallet had access/control over the bZx contracts on Polygon and BSC. By gaining access to this wallet, the attacker was able to drain funds from the bZx contracts on those chains.

So in summary:
- The attack vector was a phishing email that compromised a developer's private keys
- This gave the attacker access to bZx contracts on Polygon and BSC which they drained of funds

The code itself does not seem to have been compromised. Rather, the weakness was that a single developer wallet had too much control/access. So while human error and phishing were involved, the larger vulnerability was inadequate key management and separation of duties within bZx.
