This led to his personal mnemonic wallet phrase being compromised.</em></p></blockquote><p>Before yesterday's events, the <a href="https://bzx.network/blog/incident">last incident</a> to hit the project was in September 2020, when $8M was taken (and later returned).</p><p>Previously, in February 2020, bZx fell victim to two attacks, in which <a href="https://bzx.network/blog/postmortem-ethdenver">$298,000</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bneiluj/status/1228757175595438080">$645,000</a> were lost to the first flash loan based exploits.</p><p><strong>Looks like 4th time’s the charm for bZx.</strong></p><p>Given their chequered past, when the <a href="https://twitter.com/bZxHQ/status/1456603269355094021?s=20">announcement</a> came yesterday that the “<em>private key controlling the Polygon and BSC deployments was compromised</em>”, the replies were more of exasperation than of shock...</p><blockquote><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/BitCoinN00b/status/1456603995116654596?s=20">"What is this like 4th time?"</a></em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/AltsMang/status/1456617000692822023?s=20">"It’s probably time for you guys to just give up on this whole crypto thing. Y’all ngmi."</a></em></p></blockquote><p><strong>~10 hours after the initial announcement, bZx published an <a href="https://twitter.com/bZxHQ/status/1456749615521406978">update</a> stating that one of their devs had fallen victim to a phishing attack, stressing that the code itself hadn’t been compromised...</strong></p><p><em>Which was of little comfort for the users who lost their money.</em></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1456647033826123780">Slowmist</a> have been keeping a running total of funds lost, which at the time of writing is up to ~$55M.</p><p>It’s hard to blame the team when the attack is so sneaky. Can bZx recover, or is this their fourth and final fatality?</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>bZx have issued a <a href="https://bzx.network/blog/prelminary-post-mortem">preliminary post mortem</a>, detailing the events and containing a list of addresses used by the hacker across <a href="https://polygonscan.com/address/0xafad9352eb6bcd085dd68268d353d0ed2571af89">Polygon</a>, BSC (<a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x0ACC0e5faA09Cb1976237c3a9aF3D3d4b2f35FA5">1</a>, <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x74487eed1e67f4787e8c0570e8d5d168a05254d4">2</a>, <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x967bb571f0fc9ee79c892abf9f99233aa1737e31">3</a>) and multiple Ethereum addresses (<a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x74487eEd1E67F4787E8C0570E8D5d168a05254D4">primary wallet</a>).</strong></p><p>In place of the more technically advanced exploits that the protocol has faced in the past, this time the root of the issue was a simple phishing attack.</p><p>Sometime before the exploit, a bZx dev was sent a phishing email with an attached Word document containing a malicious macro. Opening this document resulted in the dev having the keys to their personal wallet compromised.</p><p><strong>But this was not a personal attack. This EOA had control over bZx’s Polygon and BSC deployments.</strong></p><p>The hacker was therefore able to gain control of the contracts and drain them of <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bzx-protocol">BZRX</a>. The code was then updated to enable the extraction of tokens from any wallet which had granted token approvals to the affected contracts.</p><p><strong>Check your token approvals here: <a href="https://polygonscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker">Polygon</a>, <a href="https://bscscan.com/tokenapprovalchecker">BSC</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://bzx.network/contracts">List of bZx contracts</a></strong></p><p>Despite bZx’s <a href="https://twitter.com/bZxHQ/status/1456749615521406978">attempts</a> to convince the community that the damage was contained to just Polygon and BSC, the hacker then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xee445ec9a098e9b8db744a5677422515602dc8dfb35ea60865b65c73b1704dfc">sent stolen BZRX</a> to Ethereum to use as collateral and <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xffb56ebef55a9bd4e963557bcc97594ceff97207b2aa680f7d2b9c9615cedcba">borrow</a> a variety of other assets.</p><p>Though the attacker nets less profit this way, they also find a way around the liquidity problem of attempting to dump such a large quantity of BZRX.</p><p>bZx <a href="https://bzx.network/blog/prelminary-post-mortem">state</a> that they have reached out to centralised services, requesting that Circle freeze the stolen USDC, while the funds on Binance as well as USDT were quickly frozen.</p><p>They have also <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x099aac0b0d308b7c17ea62bafbec06760cb044fb049e80ea72a810d170eafed0">reached</a> <a href="https://polygonscan.com/tx/0x8eebe7f20a89c6a63b45ed870d3f98ad5c4dc19dc7bf37ee6e050069aa48693c">out</a> to the hacker offering to “<em>chat and reach an agreement</em>”</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>The fact that such a large loss of funds can be attributed to such a simple attack vector is hard to believe, especially for a protocol that has experienced more than their fair share of security issues in the past.</strong></p><p>Anyone in crypto should be expected to be wary, and devs working on high TVL projects especially so. <em>But human error in this case should never have been able to lead to such an enormous loss</em>.</p><p><strong>But does all the blame lie with the protocol?</strong></p><p>Losing control of contracts due to their being vulnerable to a single EOA security breach is unimaginable for any responsible project, and there is no room for “<em><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/ChrisBlec/status/1456649881234415622">incompetence or negligence</a></em>” when $55M is at stake.</p><p>That being said, it takes an especially callous and greedy hacker to go on to drain individual users’ wallets after having extracted millions.</p><p><em><strong>So long rekt readers.</strong></em></p><p><em>Until next time, bZx...</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
