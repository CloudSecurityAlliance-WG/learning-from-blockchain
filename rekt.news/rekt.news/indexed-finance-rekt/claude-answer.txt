Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited several vulnerabilities:

1. The delayed update of token weights within the index pools allowed the attacker to manipulate the price/value calculation. By gradually buying up UNI tokens and decreasing UNI's weight, the attacker was able to make the pool value calculation diverge from the actual value.

2. The limits on swap sizes (no more than 1/2 the pool's balance in a token, no more than 1/3 purchase of a token) were presumably intended to limit price impact, but the attacker was able to work within those constraints to still manipulate the price over time.

3. Once the manipulated price was in place, the attacker deposited a relatively small amount of SUSHI tokens into the pool, but received a massively inflated number of index tokens (DEFI5) in return, which they then cashed out for assets in the pool. 

The key vulnerabilities were:
- Delayed weight updates 
- Pool value calculation based on extrapolated token prices
- Limits intended to prevent manipulation that were still insufficient

The attacker was very patient and deliberate in building up conditions to profit from these vulnerabilities. It does not appear there are any significant missing technical details about how the attack took place.
