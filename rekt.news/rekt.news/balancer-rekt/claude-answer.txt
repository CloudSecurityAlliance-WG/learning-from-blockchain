Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the write-up to determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector used by the attacker. 

The write-up mentions that the attacks targeted "v2 Boosted pools" on Ethereum, Optimism, and Fantom networks. It states that Balancer had disclosed a "potential threat" the previous week and advised users to withdraw funds from certain pools.

However, details of how the attack was actually carried out are not provided. The post-mortem from Balancer has apparently not yet been published. The write-up says "details of the attack vector remain under wraps" and that the article will be updated when more information is released.

Without knowing the precise vulnerability, it's impossible to explain technically how the attackers were able to steal the $2.1 million. There could be speculation about potential issues with the Boosted pools or price manipulation, but that would just be guesswork without more concrete details from Balancer about the root cause.

So in summary - there is simply not enough specific technical information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector. The best course is to await the pending post-mortem report from Balancer for the full details. Until then, we can't accurately explain the weakness the attackers exploited.
