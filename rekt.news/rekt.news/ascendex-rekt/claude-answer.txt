Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the markdown text to determine exactly how the attacker compromised AscendEX's hot wallet and stole the funds. 

The text mentions that AscendEX claimed their private keys were "compromised" but provides no details on how this occurred. It could have been the result of a security vulnerability, insider threat, social engineering attack, or something else, but there are no specifics given.

Without more technical specifics on the attack vector, vulnerabilities exploited, or security failures, I cannot reliably determine how the attack took place. The text focuses more on the impact and aftermath rather than the actual mechanics of the attack.

So in summary:

There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place
