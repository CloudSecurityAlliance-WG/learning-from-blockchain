Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack. 

The text discusses issues with the newly launched Shibarium layer 2 solution for Shiba Inu, stating that the chain stopped producing blocks shortly after launch. This prevented withdrawals from being initiated from the layer 2 side. 

However, there is no mention of an actual attack or hack. Rather, it seems to imply there were issues with the initial launch and configuration of Shibarium that caused it to stall. 

The text states that the bridge contracts hold significant value in ETH and the BONE token, but does not provide specifics on how those funds were compromised or stolen. It hints that the funds may be recoverable since the bridges are proxy contracts.

Later the text says the Shibarium developers claimed the screenshot about lost funds was fake and that "ALL IS WELL," implying any major loss of funds may not have actually happened.

So in summary, while there are suggestions of issues with Shibarium's launch and bridges, there are no technical details provided to determine what specific vulnerability enabled an attack or hack to take place. The text is unclear if any actual attack, theft or major loss event occurred.

Therefore, I cannot conclusively determine from this text alone how an attack took place. More details would be needed to fully analyze the security weakness. But it does highlight risks with newly launched layer 2 solutions like Shibarium. I would state there is not enough information provided to determine how an attack took place. Please let me know if any clarification would be helpful!
