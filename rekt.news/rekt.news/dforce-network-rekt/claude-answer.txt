Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the exploit used a known vulnerability called a "read-only reentrancy vulnerability" in some Curve pools. Specifically:

- The attacker used flash loaned funds to deposit into Curve's wstETH/ETH pool and get LP tokens
- They deposited the LP tokens into a dForce vault (wstETHCRV-gauge)
- When calling the remove_liquidity function, the attacker's contract was able to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability to manipulate the virtual price of the wstETHCRV-gauge tokens
- dForce uses the virtual price from Curve as an oracle for the value of the wstETHCRV-gauge tokens
- By manipulating the virtual price, the attacker was able to trick dForce into letting them liquidate other users' collateral at a profit

So in summary, the attacker exploited a known reentrancy vulnerability in Curve to manipulate pricing data that dForce relies on to liquidate collateral. This allowed them to steal funds from dForce vaults.

The key weaknesses were:

1) The reentrancy vulnerability in Curve allowing manipulation of virtual pricing 
2) dForce using the virtual pricing from Curve directly without additional protections

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
