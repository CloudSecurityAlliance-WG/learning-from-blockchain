Apparently, Poly still thought that an even lower bar was acceptable.</p><p>The team eventually <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675384703149568001">acknowledged</a> the attack, informing users that bridging services had been paused and making a call for help to the security community. In a follow-up, Poly <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675592129727418370">clarified</a> that “<em>57 assets have been affected on 10 blockchains</em>”</p><p><strong>Prompting flashbacks of the first hack, which at the time totalled more than the entire rest of the leaderboard combined, initial reports <a href="https://twitter.com/CertiKAlert/status/1675544670263209984">used</a> a notional value of $42B of minted assets.</strong></p><p><em>But <a href="https://twitter.com/MetisDAO/status/1675347320588718080">low liquidity</a> on destination chains meant the attacker was only able to cash out a few million.</em></p><p><strong>It seems we only ever hear of Poly Network when they’re hacked…</strong></p><p><em>…who knew they were even still around?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p>Credit: <em><a href="https://twitter.com/dedaub/status/1675516729349292032">Dedaub</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1675708122944483328">Beosin</a></em></p><p><strong>In contrast to Poly’s last incident, this time appears to be a far simpler case of compromised keys; three of four multisig signers validated deposit proofs, granting the attacker access to funds.</strong></p><p>The attack process involved locking a small amount of tokens on one chain, then withdrawing a larger amount on a different chain via forged proofs, repeated for various assets and chains.</p><p><em>A full, technical post-mortem can be found <a href="https://dedaub.com/blog/poly-chain-hack-postmortem">here</a>.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2023/01/poly2-code.png"/></figure></p><p>Attacker’s main ETH address: <strong><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe0Afadad1d93704761c8550F21A53DE3468Ba599">0xe0Afadad1d93704761c8550F21A53DE3468Ba599</a></strong></p><p>Example tx: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x1b8f8a38895ce8375308c570c7511d16a2ba972577747b0ac7ace5cc59bbb1c4">0x1b8f8a38…</a> (deposit on ETH), <a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0x5c70178e6dc882fba1663400c9566423f8942877a0d42bb5c982c95acc348e31">0x5c70178e…</a> (withdrawal on BSC)</p><p>EthCrossChainManager contract: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x14413419452aaf089762a0c5e95ed2a13bbc488c#code">0x14413419452aaf089762a0c5e95ed2a13bbc488c</a></p><p>Although the notional value of assets minted reached into the tens of billions, the attacker could only access <a href="https://twitter.com/MistTrack_io/status/1675436475595526144">around $4.4M</a> of Poly’s liquidity, with further assets remaining in the attacker’s address.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2023/01/poly2-funds.png"/></figure></p><p><em>A full list of assets stolen by chain is available <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1675592129727418370">here</a>.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>Blockchain bridges create bottlenecks where funds accumulate on either side, often secured by a flimsy threshold of just a few EOAs.</strong></p><p><em><a href="https://rekt.news/ronin-rekt/">Time</a> and <a href="https://rekt.news/harmony-rekt/">again</a> we have seen hundreds of millions lost to just a few signatures.</em></p><p>Last time Poly was rekt, <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b6009ea08c868d7c5c336bf1bc30c33b87a0eedd59dac8c26e6a8551b20b68a">on-chain negotiations</a> resulted in a happy ending, as funds were returned and the whitehat <a href="https://twitter.com/PolyNetwork2/status/1427574236483231749#">offered</a> a Chief Security Advisor role on top of a $500k bounty.</p><p><strong>Luckily, far less was lost in this time.</strong></p><p><em>Will Poly learn their lesson?</em></p><p><em>Or will they go for the hat trick?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
