Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, it seems the attack relied on a DNS hijacking/compromise rather than an exploit of a vulnerability in the blockchain protocol itself:

The key details are:

- Curve Finance's front end website curve.fi suffered a DNS hijacking, redirecting users to a malicious site.

- Curve believes the underlying nameserver was compromised by the domain registrar iwantmyname, rather than an account-level breach. 

- The malicious site prompted users to approve a malicious contract, which stole funds from approving users. 

- Over $575k was stolen from users this way.

- The exploit did not affect curve.exchange, Curve's alternate front end website.

So in summary, the attacker compromised the nameserver or DNS records of curve.fi to hijack traffic and direct it to their malicious duplicate site, tricking users into approving the malicious contract. This seems to be a DNS attack rather than an on-chain or smart contract vulnerability.

The write-up does not contain enough technical details to determine the exact method used to compromise the nameserver or DNS records. But a DNS hijack rather than an on-chain vulnerability enabled the attack. Please let me know if any part of this analysis needs clarification!
