Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the main vulnerability that enabled the attack was a weakness in the price oracle system. Specifically:

- The price submit() function was publicly callable, allowing the attacker to manipulate price data.

- This manipulated price data, combined with the malicious governance proposal to add FTS as collateral with an extremely high collateral factor, allowed the attacker to drain assets using very little FTS collateral.

So in summary, the attack took advantage of:

1. A vulnerable price oracle that could be manipulated by calling the public submit() function. 

2. A malicious governance proposal that set a high collateral factor for FTS.

3. Using the manipulated price data and now high-value FTS collateral, the attacker was able to drain assets from the platform.

The steps of the attack are clearly laid out, including funding, manipulating prices, and draining assets. There is enough technical detail provided to determine how the attack was executed through the oracle and governance weaknesses.
