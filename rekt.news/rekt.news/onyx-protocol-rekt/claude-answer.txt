Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a rounding error in the Compound v2 code that allows an attacker to manipulate empty markets in order to drain liquidity across the protocol. 

Specifically, the steps of the attack were:

1. The attacker took a flash loan of PEPE tokens.

2. They swapped the PEPE tokens for oPEPE shares, minting a small number of oPEPE shares. 

3. They then donated a large amount of PEPE tokens to the oPEPE lending pool, vastly inflating the price of oPEPE shares.

4. The inflated oPEPE shares were then used as collateral to borrow other assets from Onyx, draining liquidity.

5. The rounding error was exploited to withdraw the donated PEPE tokens.

6. The flash loan was repaid.

This "empty market attack" takes advantage of the ability to manipulate token prices in markets with very low liquidity. The fact that Onyx had recently added a market for the PEPE token with likely very low liquidity made them vulnerable.

The key preventative measure highlighted is to ensure lending markets, especially new ones, never have zero total supply of cTokens, to avoid this price manipulation vulnerability.
