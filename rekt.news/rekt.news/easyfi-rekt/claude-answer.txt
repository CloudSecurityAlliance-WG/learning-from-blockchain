Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, it seems the vulnerability or weakness that enabled the attacker to execute this attack is not clearly described. 

The post mentions that the hacker "used very sophisticated techniques" and compromised a machine that was used solely for official transfers and had access to a key that could drain all the liquidity. However, it does not provide technical details on how the machine was compromised or what specific vulnerability was exploited.

The founder compares it to the Nexus Mutual case where a compromised machine led to loss of funds. But again, it does not say how the machine was compromised.

There is criticism of the poor OPSEC used by the founders - having a single admin key capable of draining funds with no timelock or multisig. But this seems more an issue of poor security practices rather than the specific vulnerability the hacker exploited.

The post says they await a more detailed post-mortem from the founder to explain how the attack took place. As of now, there is not enough technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that enabled the attack. 

In summary:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place." More details are needed on how the hacker gained access to the founder's machine/key to carry out the theft. The poor security practices like having a single admin key are highlighted, but the post does not reveal the entry point or exploit used by the attacker.
