Message:  Based on the details provided, there does not seem to be enough information to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack. 

The article discusses the launch of Saddle Finance, which is described as a "heavily funded and promoted project that offered nothing new" and a "fork" of the Curve Finance protocol. It mentions that the Saddle Finance pools were quickly arbitraged after launch, resulting in losses for early liquidity providers. 

However, there are no technical details provided on how this arbitrage attack was executed from a smart contract/blockchain perspective. The article focuses more on criticizing the lack of innovation and the promoters of Saddle Finance, rather than analyzing the attack vector itself.

So in summary:

- Saddle Finance was launched as a fork of Curve Finance 
- Its pools were quickly arbitraged after launch
- This resulted in losses for early liquidity providers
- But there are no technical specifics provided on how the arbitrage was executed

Without more technical details on the attack flow, transactions, smart contract vulnerabilities exploited, etc., there is not enough information provided in the article to determine how the attack took place.
