It is important to note that this implementation is ported from in the Curve Finance contracts, which was used as a reference during the review. In total 14 security issues spanning across all severity levels were identified, along with a few deviations from the specification, code documentation issues and best practice issues. Due to the poor documentation we were not able to determine how the developers have derived some of the implemented formulas from the StableSwap whitepaper. Additionally, we have noticed that all tests in the current test suite use exactly 2 tokens in the pool. We strongly recommend adding more tests that use 3 or more tokens and addressing all identified issues before deploying the code in production.</em></p><p><strong><em>The implemented relation looks different (from the original StableSwap). We are not able to understand how this relation is derived from the relation in the original StableSwap paper, mentioned at the beginning of this description.</em></strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Ben Hauser of Curve said:</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>The saddle codebase includes sections of the curve codebase in it's comments to explain how it works. It also says "check the curve.fi implementation" at one point when explaining something. They clearly didn’t care much for my gas optimisations, or just lacked the ability to understand why they were optimisations.</em></p></blockquote><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/valentinmihov">Valentin Mihov</a> said:</strong></p><blockquote><p><em>In the open source world, rewriting instead of forking has certain implications. For example, if tomorrow Curve implements something new in their protocol, the rewritten system can’t just merge the changes in. They will need to spend significant time to rewrite them in their system. This is not the case for Sushi or DSD for example. This is where the difference comes imo.</em></p></blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/ivangbi_">Ivangbi</a> the TG admin provided the following analogy:</p><blockquote><p><em>"I did not copy your book, I translated it to English and added 2 pictures"</em></p></blockquote><p>Above quotes forked from l0bsterDAO <a href="https://t.me/lobsters_chat">Telegram group</a>.</p><p>Considering it took Saddle Finance six months to port the Curve code from Vyper to Solidity, the end result leaves much to be desired.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/EBADaPHqlj7W3MiLB65rrJaZtlYks79rPhXKXtJIgAJqZv5KEVH9_25qNtD0HIEejbeYWUWU1eUXkNycQIkjCsysDgsRl0VLahP4zZkjK8j9h28ZrNENDzEy3hbb-uMfmsN5sr4x"/></figure></p><p>We await the stale memes of Matt Luongo and team.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/4zcXLh4D2uiUs4jTXzgwLH6-9UxYsHv0OZbRcMf2ntQOb2NhU1B_uPh7IhAJHXhUL4iAQTtbB7S9Uv5cJ0rW_gqTONp0lBzWURaq06ga-c_JXg3_k6N1NeTnDCpf6ORN4jwEot2_"/></figure></p><p>The founders of Saddle Finance are closely linked to the Thesis project - creators of tBTC. veCRV holders expressed their views on the arrival of Saddle Finance by voting to reduce CRV rewards to the tBTC pool.</p><p>Saddle finance devops fan, Sunil Srivatsa, was not available for comment.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-BMpoiD8lzDDH6w4jnmVpYZ2-FK5DyMQfVkveIVr-6aItHPOtvEsilt0W9uuxqVORI2lsDTq6JVNS--i4YJSHVGCOs53YKxRcpw4P0ZHVX1wS7dhatO0-HIt9_WDzUb5MImJiJ4f"/></figure></p><hr/><p><strong>“Good artists borrow, great artists steal”</strong></p><p>What must have sounded like the <a href="https://twitter.com/bneiluj/status/1351582180670111748?s=20">perfect quote</a> for the imitators to include in the Saddle Finance smart contract teaches a different lesson when we turn to the original words of <a href="https://www.uvu.edu/arts/applause/posts/stealing.html">T.S Eliot</a>.</p><blockquote><p><em>Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.
