Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to drain user funds was due to an issue with the transferFrom() function in Transit Swap's smart contracts. Specifically:

"Because it is decompiled code, it is a little obscure for readers to understand. We can understand that varg0 is the token address, varg1, varg2 and varg3 are the from, to and amount parameters of the transferFrom function. 

0x23b872dd in the figure is transferFrom() function signature of the function. Therefore, the claimTokens function calls the transferFrom function of an address, and the address and function parameters are controllable."

The key points are:

1) The claimTokens function calls the transferFrom function of an arbitrary address provided by the attacker. This allows the attacker to call the transferFrom function on any token contract.

2) The from, to, and amount parameters of transferFrom are also controlled by the attacker. This allows them to transfer tokens from any user's wallet to their own wallet.

So in summary, the vulnerability stemmed from Transit Swap allowing attacker-controlled input into a transferFrom external call, enabling the draining of funds from user wallets. The unverified, closed-source nature of the contracts exacerbated the issue by preventing security audits that may have caught the vulnerability ahead of exploitation.
