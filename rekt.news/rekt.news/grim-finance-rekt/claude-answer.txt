Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a reentrancy vulnerability in the Grim Finance protocol's depositFor() function. Specifically:

- The depositFor() function was not protected against reentrancy. This allowed the attacker to call the function recursively.

- The attacker called depositFor() with their own malicious token contract that contained logic to recursively call depositFor() again on each invocation. 

- On each recursive call, the amount of GB tokens minted for the attacker was multiplied, allowing them to mint far more tokens than they should have been able to.

- After recursively calling depositFor() many times, the attacker ended up holding a huge amount of GB tokens. They then withdrew those tokens to drain value from the protocol.

The key elements allowing this attack were:

- Unprotected reentrancy vulnerability in a function that mints tokens
- Attacker contract that exploits this by recursively calling the function 
- Token minting logic that multiplied on each call

So in summary, the attacker exploited an unprotected reentrancy flaw in Grim Finance's depositFor() function to recursively mint vastly more tokens than they deposited, draining value from the protocol. The provided information clearly lays out how the attack took place.
