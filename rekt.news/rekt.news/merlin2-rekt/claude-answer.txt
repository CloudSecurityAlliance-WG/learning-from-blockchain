Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the text to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute the second attack against Merlin Labs. 

The text mentions that:

- The second attack happened 8 hours after the first attack and resulted in a loss of ~200 ETH
- The attack took advantage of a mistake in their new priceCalculator that mispriced only BAND

However, it does not provide any further details on:

- What the priceCalculator contract is, what it does, or how it was implemented
- What the specific mistake or vulnerability was that allowed the attacker to misprice BAND
- How the attacker was able to exploit this mistake to steal funds

Without more code-level or architectural details on the priceCalculator contract and the nature of the vulnerability, I cannot reliably determine the specific attack vector used. The text makes it clear a mistake was made that enabled stolen funds, but does not provide enough technical information about the smart contract logic or transactions to ascertain how.

Please let me know if you have or can provide any additional technical details about the vulnerability. Otherwise, there is insufficient information here for me to technically explain how this second attack was carried out.
