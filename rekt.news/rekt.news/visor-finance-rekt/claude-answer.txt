Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a lack of proper validation in the vVISR Rewards Contract's deposit() function. Specifically:

```
Due to a vulnerable _require()_ check in the [vVISR Rewards 
Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc9f27a50f82571c1c8423a42970613b8dbda14ef#code)â€™s
_deposit()_ function, the hacker was able to mint unlimited shares using their
own
[contract.](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10c509aa9ab291c76c45414e7cdbd375e1d5ace8)
```

The deposit() function was intended to only allow valid vVISR tokens to be deposited, but had a weak require() check that the hacker was able to bypass by calling the function from their own custom contract instead of an EOA (Externally Owned Account).

Specifically, the require() check validated that:

```
msg.sender == from.Owner()
```

Where "from" is the address depositing the vVISR tokens. By creating a contract where the Owner() function simply returned msg.sender, the hacker was able to bypass this check and deposit arbitrary amounts of vVISR tokens that they minted within their contract.

This allowed them to mint 195k fake vVISR tokens in their contract, deposit them into the vVISR Rewards Contract to burn them for real VISR tokens, and steal $8.2 million worth of funds.

The solution would have been a stronger validation in deposit() to verify the vVISR tokens originated from a legitimate source instead of relying on the weak Owner() check.
