Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Levana's price oracle mechanism. Specifically:

1. The attacker spammed transactions to prevent oracle price updates from going through, either from users or Levana's infrastructure. This allowed them to take advantage of stale pricing data.

2. They DDoSed Levana's back-end infrastructure that regularly updates the oracle prices. This further exacerbated the stale pricing issue. 

3. The attacker tracked the difference (delta) between the stale oracle prices and current market prices. 

4. When there was a significant discrepancy, the attacker quickly submitted a single multi-execute transaction that went long/short using the stale oracle price while simultaneously updating the oracle to the actual market price. Since they knew the direction and magnitude of the coming price update, this transaction was guaranteed to be profitable for them. 

5. They were able to reliably submit these attack transactions during congestion because they were the source of the congestion and could target specific nodes.

The end result is that the attacker was able to reliably exploit the stale oracle pricing to extract profit from Levana. If additional technical details about the attack process become available, please let me know and I'm happy to provide further analysis. But in summary, this was an intricate oracle manipulation attack combining congestion/DoS techniques with surgical transaction ordering and timing.
