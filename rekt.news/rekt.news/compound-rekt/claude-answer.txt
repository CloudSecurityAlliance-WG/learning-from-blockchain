Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there are not enough technical details to determine exactly how the attack was executed. 

The key points from the write-up are:

- There was a vulnerability in the updated Compound Comptroller vault that allowed wrongful distribution of $80M in excess COMP tokens.

- The Comptroller vault is refilled with 0.5 COMP per block from a Reservoir contract. At the time of the first incident, the Reservoir had not been drained in 2 months and contained over 200k COMP (~$68M).

- 3.5 days after the initial incident, someone called the drip() function on the Reservoir contract. This refilled the vulnerable Comptroller and allowed another $68.8M to be wrongly distributed.

However, the exact vulnerability or weakness that was exploited is not provided. The write-up does not give technical details on how calling drip() or interacting with the Comptroller allowed the wrongful COMP distribution. 

So in summary, while we know additional funds were stolen by refilling and re-exploiting a vulnerability in the Comptroller contract, there is insufficient technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or attack vector used.
