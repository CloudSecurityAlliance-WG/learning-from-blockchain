<strong>It’s worse than we thought.</strong></p><p><a href="https://www.rekt.news/overcompensated/">Last week,</a> a vulnerability was found in the <a href="https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/62">updated</a> Compound Comptroller vault, and ~$80M in excess COMP was wrongly distributed.</p><p>The Compound team tried to minimise the <em>perceived</em> damage, but they knew it could only get worse.</p><p>Now another ~$68.8M has been sent to the vulnerable vault, and even more COMP is being given away.</p><p><em>How did it go so wrong for Compound?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>As if the inital loss wasn't bad enough, Compound could not stop a continued attack.</strong></p><p>Any user could call <em>drip()</em> on Compound’s Reservoir vault, which would refill the Comptroller and allow for even more incorrect COMP distribution.</p><p>The Reservoir accumulates 0.5 COMP per block. At the time of the first incident, it hadn’t been drained in approximately 2 months.</p><p>With over 200k COMP (~$68M) inside the Reservoir, the Compound team could only wait and <a href="https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1444691278986457095">hope</a> that nobody would discover that the damage was far from done.</p><p>As they waited for <a href="https://compound.finance/governance/proposals/64">Proposal 64</a> to pass, which contained a fix for the original bug, <a href="https://twitter.com/rleshner">Robert Leshner</a> and the team had a tense week ahead.</p><p>However, just three and a half days after the initial event, the <a href="https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1444643482216304641?s=19">secret was out</a>, the Comptroller had been <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x02ba168f4d4fc313d095e9f0711447e8b96b26421539bd40be58243cd80a73cd">refilled</a>, and another $68.8M was sent to the vulnerable vault.</p><p><strong>As <a href="https://twitter.com/bantg/status/1444685796632670213?s=20">Banteg</a> wrote;</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you tally the initial $80m, $22m already claimed after the drip and the $45m currently at risk, the bug tallies to $147m.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/10/comp2-price.png"/></figure></p><p>Although this was more of a “bank error” than an exploit, it’s only fair that Compound takes a place on <a href="https://www.rekt.news/leaderboard/">our leaderboard</a>, where we can see that this case is not without precedent.</p><p>In the case of the failed Alchemix experiment, we saw the protocol suffer a ~$6.5M loss due to their own mistake.</p><p>Like Leshner, <a href="https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1443741220384043020">Alchemix appealed</a> for their users to return the funds, however, they were more successful in doing so.</p><p>55% of the Alchemix funds were returned, an amount which currently seems unachievable for Compound.</p><p>It’s no surprise that users are more likely to do the <em>“right thing”</em> when <a href="https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1443741220384043020">“asked nicely”</a>, rather than threatened with the authorities.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>In <a href="https://www.rekt.news/curve-wars/">Curve Wars</a>, we remembered when Robert Leshner <a href="https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1405337567139139584?s=20">said;</a></strong></p><blockquote><p>Crying to meatspace courts deeply undermines the “code is law” principles that DeFi was founded on.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>If you want courts and politicians to protect and control you, there is “finance”. If you want a system that is resilient, self-sufficient, open, and upgradable, there is DeFi.</p></blockquote><p>Now we compare those words to his <a href="https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443730726751506432?s=20">aggressive appeal</a>;</p><blockquote><p>If you received a large, incorrect amount of COMP from the Compound protocol error:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Please return it to the Compound Timelock (0x6d903f6003cca6255D85CcA4D3B5E5146dC33925).

Return the 'stolen' money and keep a clean 10%, or pay 40% to the IRS and keep a clean 60%...</p><p><strong>These nonsensical threats might have done more damage to Compound’s reputation than the multi-million dollar loss.</strong></p><p><em>Leshner has <a href="https://twitter.com/rleshner/status/1443759189722116097?s=20">since apologised</a> for his words, but can his reputation be repaired?</em></p><p><strong>It’s still not clear how (or if) the existing legal and financial systems will cope with the new concept that is decentralised finance, but for now...</strong></p><p><em>If you truly want DeFi, then you have to accept the responsibility that comes with it.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
