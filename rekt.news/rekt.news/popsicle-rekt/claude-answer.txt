Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a lack of proper fee accounting when liquidity provider (LP) tokens are transferred between different contracts. Specifically:

1. The attacker created 3 contracts - A, B, and C. 

2. Contract A deposited tokens into Popsicle Finance's pools and received LP tokens.

3. Contract A transferred the LP tokens to contract B.

4. Contract B called collectFees() which incorrectly updated its token rewards.

5. Contract B transferred the LP tokens to contract C.

6. Contract C called collectFees(), again incorrectly updating its token rewards.

7. By repeating this process of transferring LP tokens between contracts and calling collectFees(), the attacker was able to collect more fees than they were entitled to. 

The key pieces of information are:

- "The hack was due to the lack of proper fee accounting when LP tokens are transferred"
- "Specifically, the attacker creates three contracts: A, B, and C and repeats in the sequences of: A.deposit(), A.transfer(B), B.collectFees(), B.transfer(C), C.collectFees()"

This allows the attacker to collect fees multiple times for the same LP tokens by transferring them between contracts.

So in summary, the vulnerability was an inaccurate tracking of fees owed when LP tokens were transferred between contracts. This allowed the attacker to collect fees multiple times that they were not entitled to.
