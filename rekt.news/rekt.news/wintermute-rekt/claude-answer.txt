Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited the fact that Wintermute had provided the address of their multisig wallet on Ethereum as the destination address on Optimism, but did not actually control that address on Optimism. Specifically:

1. Wintermute provided the address 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 on Optimism to receive OP tokens, but this was actually the address of their multisig wallet on Ethereum which they did not control on Optimism. 

2. The attacker realized the address on Optimism was not owned by anyone and they could deploy a contract to that address by brute forcing the proxy contract creation until the nonce matched the original proxy contract creation on Ethereum.

3. The attacker funded an address on Optimism and deployed batches of Gnosis safe proxy contracts using a ProxyFactory contract they adapted until they got a proxy contract deployment at the desired 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 address on Optimism.

4. By deploying a proxy contract to the unowned 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 address, the attacker gained control of that address and could access the OP tokens sent there.

In summary, the attacker exploited Wintermute's operational security failure in providing an address they didn't control for receiving funds. The attacker realized this address was free to claim on Optimism and managed to deploy the necessary proxy contract to gain control of the tokens.
