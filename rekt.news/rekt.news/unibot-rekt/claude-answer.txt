Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The key details that are missing are:

1. The actual vulnerable code in the Unibot router contract. The writeup shows a diagram of the vulnerable code, but does not include the actual code. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to fully understand the specifics of the vulnerability.

2. Precise details on how the attacker was able to exploit the vulnerability. The writeup speculates that there was a lack of input validation that allowed an arbitrary call, but does not confirm the exact exploit flow. 

Some possibilities based on the limited information:

- There was a reentrancy vulnerability that allowed the attacker to make multiple draining transferFrom calls before state was updated.

- There was a way for the attacker to directly invoke the transferFrom function in the router contract to drain tokens from users. This could be due to a lack of input validation, authorization check, or access control issue.

But without the specific contract code or confirmed exploit details, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability leveraged by the attacker. The key phrase that sums this up is:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place"

Please let me know if any additional details from the writeup could help further analyze the attack vector. I'm happy to provide another assessment given more specific code snippets or attack confirmations.
