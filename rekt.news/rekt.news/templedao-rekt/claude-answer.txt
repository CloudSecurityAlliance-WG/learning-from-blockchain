Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this hack was an unchecked parameter in the StaxLPStaking contract's migrateStake() function. 

Specifically, the migrateStake() function did not validate that the oldStaking parameter passed to it was a valid staking contract. This allowed the attacker to:

1. Create their own malicious contract with the same oldStaking interface.

2. Call the migrateStake() function, specifying an arbitrary deposit amount and their own address to receive the funds. 

3. Receive the LP tokens from the StaxLPStaking contract.

4. Swap the stolen LP tokens for ETH.

The key lines from the article summarizing this vulnerability are:

"The StaxLPStaking contractâ€™s migrateStake() function did not contain any checks that the oldStaking parameter was valid. This meant that anyone could create a contract with the same oldStaking parameter, specifying an arbitrary deposit amount and address to which the funds could be sent."

By failing to validate a critical parameter, the developers enabled this simple attack that allowed the attacker to drain funds from the protocol. This demonstrates the importance of thoroughly validating any external or untrusted inputs to smart contracts, especially those dealing with financial assets.
