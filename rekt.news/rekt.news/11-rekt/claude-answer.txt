Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there are not enough details provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The key pieces of information provided are:

- The attack targeted the NRV vault of Eleven Finance, allowing the attacker to drain funds from nrvBTC, nrvETH and nrvFUSDT balances.

- A vulnerable `emergencyBurn()` function in the intermediate vault contract allowed the attacker to withdraw deposited balances without proper accounting.

- The attacker used flash loans of underlying assets (BTCB, ETH, USDT) to mint the Nerve assets nrvBTC, nrvETH, nrvFUSDT and deposit them into the vulnerable contract.

- By calling `emergencyBurn()`, the attacker was able to withdraw the entire intermediate vault balance.

However, the exact details of how the `emergencyBurn()` function was exploited are not provided. There are no code snippets, specifics on input parameters or return values, or explanations of how balances were improperly tracked after `emergencyBurn()` was called.

Without these additional technical details, there is not enough information to conclusively determine the precise vulnerability and how the attack took place from a coding perspective. 

In summary, the key phrase that applies here is: "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place." More specific technical details would be needed to fully analyze the attack vector. Please let me know if any additional information can be provided!
