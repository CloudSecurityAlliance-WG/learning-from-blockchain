Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no clear technical details about how the CoinEx hack specifically occurred. 

The article mentions that CoinEx has not yet announced how the security breach happened. It states that attackers were able to drain funds from CoinEx's hot wallets, indicating a compromise of private keys or improper security controls.

Some key pieces of information that would help determine the exact vulnerability used:

- How the private keys were stored and accessed. Were they encrypted properly? Was there an insider threat? 

- What permissions did the compromised keys have? Full withdrawal rights?

- Were there any secondary approvals or controls bypass? 

- Were there any phishing attempts on employees? 

Without more specific details from CoinEx on their infrastructure and security controls, there is not enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place. The article provides excellent background and impact details but lacks the technical specificity needed. I will refrain from speculating beyond what has been confirmed.
