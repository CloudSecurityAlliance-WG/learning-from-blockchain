Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the root cause of the exploit was a rounding error vulnerability in the CauldronV4 contracts used by Abracadabra. Specifically:

The borrow function was vulnerable to manipulation of the "part" parameter (the user's share of total debt) by repeatedly borrowing and repaying an asset. This took advantage of a rounding error that allowed the attacker to incorrectly calculate their debt.

This enabled the attacker to:

1. Flash loan MIM tokens
2. Deposit MIM tokens into BentoBox to enable the ERC-4626 "first depositor" vulnerability
3. Repay liabilities for other users
4. Repeatedly borrow and repay to inflate the share price (the ERC-4626 vulnerability) 
5. Add collateral and borrow a large amount of MIM
6. Repay the flash loan and take profits

The resulting MIM dump by the attacker caused the depegging event.

In summary, the attack combined flash loans, manipulation of the "part" parameter via a rounding vulnerability, and ERC-4626 vulnerabilities to steal funds. The technical details provided give a clear picture of how the attack was executed.
