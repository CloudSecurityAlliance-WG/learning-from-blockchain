Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to definitively determine how the attack took place. 

The key pieces of information that are missing include:

1. The exact details of the "zero-day exploit on Solidly swaps" that allowed the attacker to manipulate the Muon oracle's view of the USDC/DEI price. The article mentions using flash swaps in some way but does not provide specifics.

2. How the attacker was able to replicate the price manipulation of the on-chain USDC/DEI pool that was used in the previous attack last month. The steps of the attack are summarized at a high level but the technical details of how the price manipulation was achieved are not provided.

3. How the attacker was able to connect the manipulated prices from the two oracles (Muon off-chain and on-chain USDC/DEI pool) to trick the Deus lending platform. The relationship and integration details between the oracles and lending platform are not covered.

So in summary, while the article provides a good high-level overview of the incident, there are several critical technical gaps that prevent a definitive assessment of how each component of the attack was executed from an exploit and vulnerability perspective. Given the missing details, I cannot reliably determine the full attack flow.
