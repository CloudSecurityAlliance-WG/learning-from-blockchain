Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there does not seem to be enough details to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The article mentions that approximately 8,000 Solana addresses were compromised, with funds being directly transferred from those addresses to the exploiter's addresses. This suggests the private keys of the affected addresses were likely compromised in some way.

Some theories mentioned include:

- A leak in a browser extension or mobile wallet
- Mobile malware
- An ECDSA nonce reuse issue
- A widespread malware attack on GitHub repos
- An "iOS supply chain attack" affecting users who imported/generated keys on mobile

However, there is no clear evidence provided to confirm any of these theories. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko hints at an iOS supply chain attack, but no specifics are given. 

The article states that investigations into the root cause are still ongoing. More details would be needed to conclusively determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector used by the exploiter to compromise so many wallets. 

In summary, there is not enough information provided in the article to determine how the attack took place. More technical details on the affected wallets and transactions would be needed.
