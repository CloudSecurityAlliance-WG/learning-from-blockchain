Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector used in this incident. 

The key details we know are:

- 96 user accounts had their private keys compromised, allowing the attacker to drain wallet contents including PYR tokens, ETH, and MATIC
- The funds were initially sent to an Ethereum address and a Polygon address controlled by the attacker
- The Vulcan Forged team claims the hacker funds have been traced to a KYC'd exchange address
- The Vulcan Forged team uses Venly to provide integrated wallets for user accounts

However, there is no technical detail on how the private keys were actually obtained by the attacker. Possibilities include:

- A vulnerability in Venly's wallet infrastructure that allowed key theft 
- A server-side breach of Venly or Vulcan Forged that gave access to keys
- Client-side malware that stole keys from users' devices
- Individual user security failures like phishing that compromised keys

Without more insight into Venly's architecture, Vulcan's integration, or how the keys were taken, it's impossible to determine the specific attack vector. The report is correct that without these details, we can't assign blame or know if it was truly "compromised keys". There simply isn't enough information provided to determine how the attack took place. More details from Venly or Vulcan Forged are needed to conduct a proper post-mortem.
