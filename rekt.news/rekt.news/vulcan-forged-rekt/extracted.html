As well as $PYR, users also lost substantial amounts of other tokens including ETH and MATIC.</p><p>Hacker’s address on:</p><p><strong><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x48ad05a3B73c9E7fAC5918857687d6A11d2c73B1">Ethereum</a></strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://polygonscan.com/address/0x48ad05a3B73c9E7fAC5918857687d6A11d2c73B1">Polygon</a></strong></p><p>Funds have since been sent on to further wallets, for example <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe3cd90be37a79d9da86b5e14e2f6042cd0e53b66">this one</a> containing ~$40M in $PYR and ~$600k in ETH.</p><p>The team <a href="https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470209893114294282">claims</a> to have identified an address that may be linked to a KYC’d exchange.</p><p>A total of over 4.5M PYR was extracted, with a value of ~$140M at the time of the attack.</p><p>Subsequent sales of the stolen PYR had a large impact on the token price, which dropped ~30% initially, from around $31 to a low of $21.47.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p>In contrast to the other cases, the Vulcan team has been quick to <a href="https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470201106626224140">respond</a> to the incident, posting regular <a href="https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470315106986827777">updates</a> on their Twitter feed and promising to both replace the stolen $PYR and remove the custodial wallets.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://twitter.com/VulcanForged/status/1470365117774770180">latest update</a>, the majority of affected wallets have already been  reimbursed from the treasury, and the team aims to pursue a 100% decentralised system going forward.</p><p><em>The response from the team has been better than most, but that doesn’t mean we should be less suspicious.</em></p><p>“Compromised keys” can’t be analysed by outsiders; a fact which benefits only the insiders.</p><p>Who is to blame for this incident? Is it Vulcan Forged, for a lack of due diligence, or their wallet provider; Venly?</p><p><em>Without further details; we will never know.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
