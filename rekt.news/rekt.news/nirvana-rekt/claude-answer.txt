Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a price manipulation vulnerability to profit from Nirvana Finance's treasury. Specifically:

1) The attacker took out a $10M flash loan from Solend.

2) They used the borrowed funds to mint a large amount of ANA tokens from Nirvana Finance. This inflated the price of ANA from ~$8 to ~$24. 

3) The attacker then exchanged the overpriced ANA for USDT from Nirvana's treasury, netting themselves around $3.5M profit.

4) They paid back the flash loan while keeping the $3.5M USDT profit.

So in summary, the attacker manipulated the price of ANA by minting a large amount with borrowed funds. They then cashed out at the inflated price to profit from Nirvana's treasury. This appears to be the key vulnerability they exploited - the ability to artificially inflate ANA's price and cash out from the treasury.
