Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this attack was:

The SocketGateway contract added a new route 3 days prior to the exploit without properly validating user input in the swapExtraData parameter. This allowed the attacker to inject a transferFrom call that sent approved tokens from victims' addresses to the attacker's contract.

Specifically, the contract did not consider the case where the caller transfers in 0 WETH, which let the attacker specify other functions in the call while still passing the balance check.

The key details that indicate how the attack took place are:

- Lack of input validation on the newly added contract route's swapExtraData parameter
- Attacker able to inject a transferFrom call by sending 0 WETH
- Victims had previously approved the SocketGateway contract, allowing their tokens to be transferred out by the injected call

In summary, insufficient input validation on a new contract route added shortly before the incident allowed an arbitrary call injection due to improper assumptions about msg.value, enabling theft from accounts that had granted prior approval to the bridge.
