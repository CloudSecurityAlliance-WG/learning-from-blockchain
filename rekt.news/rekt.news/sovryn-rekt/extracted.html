Notice that the attacker minted 26,000 side tokens into 22,653 Load Token, while in the closeWithDeposit function, there is no such mint function.</p><p>Then we found that the attacker used the side tokens to call the attack contract externally, and used the attack contract to call the mint function.</p><p>Because in the tokenPrice function, it relies on the number of side tokens to calculate the Load token price, and the total number of tokens has not been updated at this time, resulting in the attacker getting more Load tokens.</p><p>Finally, the attacker calls the burn function to burn 22,653 Load Token to get 27,086 side token.</p><p>Then the attacker calls the related function in a loop to get the side token, and finally converts them to RBTC.</p><p>The stolen funds were deposited into Tornado cash.</p></blockquote><p>An <a href="https://www.sovryn.app/blog/interim-exploit-update">update</a> posted on October 7th assures that no Sovryn individuals need to worry, stating that:</p><blockquote><p>Roughly half of the funds have been recovered so far</p><p>Potential remaining user losses will be fully covered by the Exchequer</p></blockquote><p>And five days after the attack, <a href="https://twitter.com/SovrynBTC/status/1578770047643762689">a final announcement:</a></p><blockquote><p>”All user funds stuck on the ETH bridge have been unstuck.
