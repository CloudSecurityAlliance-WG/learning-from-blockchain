Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Seneca's approval process to drain assets from user wallets. Specifically:

**The attacker constructed malicious calldata parameters to call the transferFrom and transfer functions, allowing them to transfer tokens that users had approved to Seneca's contracts to the attacker's address.**

This was possible because:

- Seneca's contracts had over-privileged approval capabilities that allowed the transfer of any approved tokens.
- The contracts could not be paused due to an issue with the pause function implementation - the pause and unpause functions were internal, so there was no way to call them to stop the attack.

The attacker was able to steal undeployed LSTs and over 1.9k ETH by exploiting this approval vulnerability. 

The analysis shows the specific transactions and addresses involved in the attack. It also covers Seneca's flawed handling of the situation, including their claims of battle-tested code and lack of responsibility.

Overall, there are sufficient technical details provided to determine precisely how the attack exploited Seneca's approval process and drained assets from user wallets.
