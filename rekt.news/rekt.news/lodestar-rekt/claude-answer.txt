Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this attack was a price manipulation of the plvGLP collateral asset on Lodestar Finance. Specifically:

- Lodestar Finance relied on its own GLPOracle contract to provide pricing for the plvGLP asset, rather than an external oracle like Chainlink.

- The GLPOracle contract did not properly account for the impact of the `donate()` function in the GlpDepositor contract, which allows inflating the assets of the GlpDepositor and thus the price of plvGLP. 

- Using flash loans, the attacker was able to manipulate the price of plvGLP reported by the GLPOracle to be artificially high. 

- This allowed the attacker to borrow much more funds from Lodestar than they should have been able to based on their plvGLP collateral.

- The attacker then drained the lending pools of ~$6.5M and made away with the profits.

In summary, the core vulnerability was the manipulation of the custom GLPOracle price feed for plvGLP due to not properly accounting for the donate() function's impact. This allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their borrowing power and profit.
