Cefi and OTC operations are not affected</p><p>We are solvent with twice over that amount in equity left</p></blockquote><p><strong>The firm’s CEO states that the use of the vanity address was for “<a href="https://twitter.com/EvgenyGaevoy/status/1572181989242937345"><em>gas savings</em></a>” rather than aesthetics… an expensive choice.</strong></p><p><strong>Last time Wintermute got rekt, the exploiter <a href="https://twitter.com/RektHQ/status/1535225173179260933">returned</a> (most of) the funds.</strong></p><p><em>Will they stay lucky this time around?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>Hacker’s address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705">0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705</a></strong></p><p>Attack contract: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26">0x0248f752802b2cfb4373cc0c3bc3964429385c26</a></p><p><strong>Main attack tx: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xedd31e2a949b7957a786d44b071dbe1bc5abd5c57e269edb9ec2bf1af30e9ec4">0xedd31e2a…</a></strong></p><p>Second attack tx: <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc253450fc3e0e124224aef2936c13b371a86056e82e778113fc3ce8800bbe876">0xc253450f…</a></p><p>The likely cause of the hack was a weakness in the <a href="https://blog.1inch.io/a-vulnerability-disclosed-in-profanity-an-ethereum-vanity-address-tool-68ed7455fc8c">Profanity tool</a> used for creating vanity addresses. Following last week’s revelation of the Profanity vulnerability, <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1570927217840132097">$3.3M was drained</a> from various wallets by <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x6AE09AC63487FCf63117A6D6FAFa894473d47b93">0x6AE09A…</a> over the following days.</p><p>Both Wintermute’s <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000fe6a514a32abdcdfcc076c85243de899b">hot wallet</a> and <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000ae347930bd1e7b0f35588b92280f9e75">DeFi vault contract</a> appear to have vanity addresses, with multiple leading zeros. The hot wallet’s private key was likely compromised and used to drain the vault.</p><p>Though the weak security of Profanity-generated addresses only came into the spotlight recently, the <a href="https://github.com/johguse/profanity/issues/61">issue was raised</a> on the project’s GitHub back in January.</p><p>As described by <a href="https://mudit.blog/wintermute-muted-in-crypto-winter/">Mudit Gupta</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The vault only allows admins to do these transfers and Wintermute’s hot wallet is an admin, as expected. Therefore, the contracts worked as expected but the admin address itself was likely compromised.</p><p>Around the time that the disclosure happened, Wintermute <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x93716f3e3a9e3f47dec05b4df511e07e53b3e4695e84cd4f05f5d83188f3552a">removed all ether</a> from this admin address which suggests that they realized it might have been vulnerable. However, they forgot to remove the address as an admin from their vault.</p></blockquote><p>The stolen funds were mostly various stablecoins, totalling $118.4M. The majority of these were deposited into Curve’s 3pool, presumably in an attempt to avoid any blacklisting.</p><p><strong>The exploiter is now the <a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0x6c3f90f043a72fa612cbac8115ee7e52bde6e490#balances">3rd largest holder</a> of 3CRV with over 13% of the supply.</strong></p><p><em>Tornado 3pool?</em></p><p>The remaining loot is comprised of 671 WBTC (~$13M) and 6,928 ETH ($9.4M) and a <a href="https://debank.com/profile/0xe74b28c2eAe8679e3cCc3a94d5d0dE83CCB84705">variety</a> of other tokens.
