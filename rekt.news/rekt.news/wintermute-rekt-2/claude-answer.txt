Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this hack was a weakness in the Profanity tool used to generate vanity addresses for Wintermute's hot wallet and DeFi vault contract. Specifically:

- Profanity was found to have a vulnerability that compromised the security of vanity addresses it generated. This was disclosed publicly in the past week.

- Wintermute's hot wallet and DeFi vault contract both used Profanity-generated vanity addresses, likely to save on gas fees. 

- The private key for the hot wallet was probably compromised due to the Profanity vulnerability. 

- The hacker then used the compromised private key to drain funds from the DeFi vault contract, which had authorized the hot wallet as an admin. So the contracts worked as intended, but the hot wallet admin key was compromised.

- Wintermute had apparently realized the addresses were vulnerable when the Profanity issue was disclosed, as they moved ETH out of the hot wallet. But they failed to remove it as an authorized admin on their DeFi vault.

So in summary, the specific vulnerability was the weak vanity address generation in Profanity, which Wintermute relied on for their hot wallet and vault contract. This allowed the hacker to compromise the hot wallet private key and then drain the vault.
