Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the Inverse Finance lending protocol related to price oracles and liquidity. Specifically:

1. The attacker manipulated the price of the INV token on SushiSwap by swapping a large amount of ETH to INV. This temporarily spiked the INV price due to low liquidity on that trading pair.

2. The Inverse Finance lending protocol uses a TWAP (time-weighted average price) oracle that sources price data from SushiSwap. So the spiked INV price on SushiSwap was reflected in the oracle.

3. The attacker then deposited the manipulated INV as collateral and borrowed almost $16 million worth of assets against it. Essentially putting up $600k worth of INV and borrowing assets worth far more based on the inflated price from the oracle.

4. Once the assets were borrowed, the attacker disappeared with them, leaving the manipulated INV behind as bad debt collateral.

So in summary, the attack exploited:

- Illiquidity allowing price manipulation on SushiSwap 
- The lending protocol's reliance on a single DEX for price data
- Short time windows for the TWAP oracle allowing manipulation

This allowed the attacker to borrow far more assets than their collateral was actually worth. Technical execution was complex, involving flash loans, spam transactions, clean addresses, etc. But the core issues were around liquidity and price oracles.
