Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it does not seem there is enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The post mentions that "Despite their bold claims of security, it appears the Value DeFi team didnâ€™t know that withdrawals could be made not only through the main Bank contract, but also from the Vault contract through Proxy." This suggests there may have been a vulnerability or oversight in the Value DeFi contracts that allowed the attacker to withdraw funds through an unexpected code path.

However, there are no specific details provided on how the attacker was actually able to exploit this. The post also mentions manipulation occurring at certain steps and a withdrawal using the "wrong Curve function" but does not elaborate on what that entailed from a technical standpoint. 

So in summary - while there are hints at potential vulnerabilities, there are not enough technical specifics provided to determine conclusively how the attack exploited those vulnerabilities from a code perspective. The key phrase that sums it up is: "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place." More details on the contracts, transactions, and code paths the attacker used would be needed to fully understand the nature of the attack.
