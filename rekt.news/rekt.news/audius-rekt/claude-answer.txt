Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to execute this attack was:

The attacker was able to take control of the Audius governance contract by exploiting a known issue with storage collisions between the AudiusAdminUpgradabilityProxy contract and the OpenZeppelin Initializable contract. 

Specifically:

- The AudiusAdminUpgradabilityProxy contract sets the proxyAdmin address in storage slot 0. 

- This creates a collision with the Initializable contract, which also uses storage slot 0.

- This allowed the attacker to reinitialize the Audius governance contract and take control of it by setting themself as the new admin.

- Once in control of the governance contract, the attacker could change parameters and increase their own voting power. 

- They then used their increased voting power to pass a malicious proposal that transferred 18M AUDIO tokens from the treasury to their own address.

In summary, the vulnerability was a known storage collision issue that allowed the attacker to take control of the Audius governance contract and exploit it to steal funds.
