We are still in communication with CEXs to confirm their understanding of this</p><p>This information strongly makes me think this was an intentional market manipulation attempt by a well capitalized actor(s) designed to drain funds from the dYdX insurance pool</p></blockquote><p>The team appears to be confident that they’ll track down whoever is responsible, though, <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1726285820620103787">offering</a> bounties to anyone who can provide info, but refusing to negotiate with the exploiter themself.</p><p><em>Maybe the way things worked out for Avi has given dYdX a <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1726286931133452514">confidence</a> boost?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>In response to the attack, dYdX have <a href="https://twitter.com/dYdX/status/1725949443445309936">added</a> extra margin requirements for lower liquidity tokens.</strong></p><p><em>However, the responses have provoked criticism for perceived <a href="https://twitter.com/napgener/status/1726295733517861149">hypocrisy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kaiynne/status/1726340695034884493">skirting</a> decentralised decision-making.</em></p><p><strong>Not to worry, though, negative feedback “<em><a href="https://twitter.com/antoniomjuliano/status/1726566858466504950">doesn’t matter</a></em>”.</strong></p><p>While DEX code may be a case of set-and-forget, margin and lending protocols need constant <a href="https://twitter.com/DeFi_Made_Here/status/1726238750642971000">tweaking</a> in response to market conditions, and dYdX’s <a href="https://twitter.com/AntonioMJuliano/status/1726350318794060084">coming</a> pivot to a standalone chain is set to feature full decentralisation.</p><p>Governance may have its own flaws (<em>and <a href="https://twitter.com/functi0nZer0/status/1725922016484597975">weaknesses</a></em>), but decisions made behind closed doors usually don’t sit well with the community.</p><p>However, when everyone gets their own say on risk management…</p><p><em>…who’s to blame when things go wrong?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
