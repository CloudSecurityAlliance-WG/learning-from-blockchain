Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the Orion Protocol's ExchangeWithAtomic contract. Specifically:

1. The exchange contract was not protected from reentrancy. 

2. The attacker took out a flash loan of 284,700 USDT.

3. The attacker then called the doSwapThroughOrionPool function to swap the USDT for the attacker's malicious ATK token and then back to USDT. 

4. During the token swap, the ATK token's transfer function called back into the exchange contract's depositAsset function. This reentrancy resulted in the flash loaned USDT being deposited again, doubling the balance.

5. After the swap completed, the attacker's balance was recorded as 5.68 million USDT instead of the original flash loan amount.

6. The attacker withdrew the excess USDT for profit.

In summary, the lack of reentrancy protection allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their balance by recursively calling back into the contract. This vulnerability allowed them to steal $3 million in funds. The technical details provided confirm how the attack took place.
