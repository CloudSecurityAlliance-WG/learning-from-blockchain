Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attack took place. The key details that are missing are:

1. How the attacker gained access to the Feeto address that had max approvals to drain the liquidity pools. The write-up states this was granted on deployment but does not explain how the attacker obtained or accessed this address.

2. How the backdoor/vulnerability worked from a technical perspective that allowed the attacker to drain funds. The write-up mentions there are claims of an intentional backdoor in the code but does not confirm this or provide any code snippets or specifics on the vulnerability. 

3. Exactly what privileges or roles were centralized that CertiK's audit warned about and how the attacker was able to exploit those. The write-up does say that Merlin promised to use a multisig to CertiK but does not confirm if this was actually implemented.

So in summary, while the write-up provides background on the incident itself and the aftermath, there are no technical specifics provided to determine precisely how the attack exploited weaknesses in the code or blockchain logic. Without more code-level detail or specifics on unauthorized account access, the exact vulnerability cannot be pinpointed. Please let me know if any additional attack vectors or vulnerabilities are suspected so I can re-analyze.
