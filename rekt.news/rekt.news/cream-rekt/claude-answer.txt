Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to conclusively determine how the attack on Cream Finance took place. 

The key pieces of information that are missing are:

1. Technical details on the specific vulnerability in the AMP token contract that enabled reentrancy. The write-up mentions that the AMP token uses ERC77-based ERC1820 which has a callPreTransferHooks function that enabled reentrancy, but does not specify the vulnerable code.

2. Technical specifics on how the attacker exploited the reentrancy vulnerability to steal funds. The steps listed describe the general flow of stealing WETH collateral, borrowing AMP tokens, exploiting the reentrancy bug, and liquidating part of the loan. But the exact vulnerability code and sequence of reentrant calls is not shown.

Without those technical specifics on the vulnerable contract code and exact exploit transaction flow, there is not enough information to fully determine how the attack took place from a technical perspective.

In summary, the key phrase that applies here is: "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place." More specific technical details would be needed to fully analyze the vector and provide a conclusive explanation. Please let me know if any additional details can be provided.
