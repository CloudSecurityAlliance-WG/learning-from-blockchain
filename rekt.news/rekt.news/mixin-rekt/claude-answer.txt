Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, it seems the attacker gained access to a database belonging to Mixin Network's cloud service provider that contained private keys of Mixin Network users. 

Specifically, the article states:

"the database of Mixin Network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers, resulting in the loss of some assets on the mainnet"

and

"The transactions appear to be simple transfers, which would suggest a leak of Mixin usersâ€™ private keys held on the cloud service."

So the vulnerability was that Mixin Network was storing users' private keys on a centralized database run by a third-party cloud provider. By hacking into this database, the attacker was able to steal the private keys and use them to transfer funds out of user wallets.

The article does not provide full technical details on precisely how the database was compromised, but the key factors were:

1) Private keys were stored centrally rather than in a decentralized manner
2) The centralized database was run by a third-party service provider rather than by Mixin Network itself
3) The service provider's security was breached, enabling access to the private keys

So in summary, the vulnerability was Mixin's reliance on a centralized point of failure to store sensitive user data. This allowed the private keys to be stolen once the third-party database was compromised.
