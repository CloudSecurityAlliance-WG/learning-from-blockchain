An english summary of the livestream (promised in the initial announcement) is yet to be published.</p><p>News of a relatively unheard-of platform losing nine figures brings back memories of Poly Network’s <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>-topping <a href="https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/">incident</a> in August 2021. And just goes to demonstrate the vast <a href="https://twitter.com/pcaversaccio/status/1706215712237216206">disconnect</a> between crypto communities across the globe.</p><p><strong>Mixin Network claims to be “decentralised”, but has blamed the losses on a hacked third-party database.</strong></p><p><em>Something doesn’t add up...</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>The details of precisely how funds were drained have not yet been disclosed.</strong></p><p>But Mixin wasted no time in shifting the blame:</p><blockquote><p>the database of Mixin Network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers, resulting in the loss of some assets on the mainnet</p></blockquote><p><strong>The transactions appear to be simple transfers, which would suggest a leak of Mixin users’ private keys held on the cloud service.</strong></p><p><em>BlockSec also <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1706319766544155068">believe</a> that some of the addresses drained may have been Mixin’s hot wallets.</em></p><p>The stolen funds accounted for so far are comprised of ETH, USDT (swapped to unfreeable DAI) and BTC, with not an illiquid shitcoin in sight.</p><p>The announcement states that Mixin is in contact with Google (presumably the ‘service provider’ in question) and <a href="https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1706133260869468503">SlowMist</a> to aid in the investigation.</p><p>Attacker <a href="https://t.me/investigations/41">addresses</a> (identified so far, with approx $50M still to be accounted for):</p><p><strong><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x52E86988bd07447C596e9B0C7765F8500113104c">0x52E86988bd07447C596e9B0C7765F8500113104c</a></strong> -
