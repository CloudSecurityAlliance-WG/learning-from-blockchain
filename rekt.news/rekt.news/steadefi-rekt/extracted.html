From there, the exploiter:</p><blockquote><p>went on to take various owner-only actions such as allowing any wallet to be able to borrow any available funds from the lending vaults.</p></blockquote><p>The attack drained all funds available for borrowing on both Arbitrum and Avalanche, with the only funds protected being deposits in the ‘Depositor vaults’. Steadefi’s <a href="https://defillama.com/protocol/steadefi">TVL</a> fell from over $2M to just $550k.</p><p>At least some of the remaining TVL appears to have been locked in contracts by the exploiter:</p><blockquote><p>However, the exploiter has also paused the farms contract, which means that if you (and the majority of everyone is) has your svTokens or ibTokens deposited in the farms, you will not be able to withdraw them as well. However, the exploiter is also unable to withdraw them.</p></blockquote><p>The funds were swapped to ~625 ETH and bridged to Ethereum before being forwarded onto <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe10d4a5bd440775226c7e1858f573e379d0aca36">another address</a>, where they remain.</p><p>Attacker’s address (<a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc">ETH</a>, <a href="https://arbiscan.io/address/0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc">ARB</a>, <a href="https://snowtrace.io/address/0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc">AVAX</a>): <strong>0x9cf71F2ff126B9743319B60d2D873F0E508810dc</strong></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>With many projects having <a href="https://twitter.com/PeckShieldAlert/status/1688404426825117697">funds returned</a> recently, Steadefi may be hoping for a happy ending.</strong></p><p>However, given that this incident was due to an account compromise and not a potential whitehat poking about for bugs in a smart contract, we won’t be holding our breath.</p><p><em>Especially if certain state-sponsored <a href="https://rekt.news/big-phish/">phisherman</a> are involved…</em></p><p>But who knows, between Arkham’s opening of a <a href="https://rekt.news/arkham-asylum/">public doxx-market</a> and Curve’s <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1687180381714358272">bounty hunter reward</a>, we may be seeing the emergence of a new post-hack strategy.</p><p>In the case of Curve, one bounty hunter (or on-chain bluffer) has <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf600ef0425ba2a57837b4b6b277db5bbafaba5625ce2010e1a00c611b4a2b1df">already opted</a> to go straight to the source rather than take the 10%:</p><blockquote><p>Hacker.
