Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was the compromise of the Steadefi deployer address. Specifically:

"According to Steadefi’s own [announcement](https://twitter.com/steadefi/status/1688638572608552960), the deployer address of the protocol was compromised."

Since the deployer address owned all the vault contracts, the attacker was able to use their compromised access to transfer ownership of the contracts to themselves:

"As the deployer was the owner of all of the platform’s vault contracts, the attacker was able to transfer ownership (for example, the USDC vault on Abritrum [in this tx](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x1e94a17f392c77fd897b4bfb66a1364b5508de6b2a36f3b0227a4a9ca4a657f0)) to their own address."

After gaining ownership, the attacker was then able to drain funds by taking "owner-only actions such as allowing any wallet to be able to borrow any available funds from the lending vaults."

So in summary, the key vulnerability was the ability for the compromised deployer address to transfer ownership of critical contracts to the attacker, enabling the theft of funds. This was due to a successful phishing attack or other compromise of the original deployer address. There are no further technical details provided on exactly how the deployer address was compromised.
