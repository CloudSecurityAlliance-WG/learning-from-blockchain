Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to determine exactly how the attacker gained access and exploited the vulnerability. 

The key facts stated are:

- The MM.finance site experienced a DNS attack where the attacker managed to inject a malicious contract address into the frontend code.

- The attacker "used a DNS vulnerability to modify the router contract address in our hosted files."

- This resulted in user transactions being rerouted to the attacker's address.

However, there are no details provided on:

- How the DNS vulnerability was exploited and what specifically it was
- How the attacker gained access to modify hosted files
- Whether files were modified directly on the server or via another method
- What the malicious contract address was and what it did

So while it seems transactions were rerouted due to a modified router contract address, the exact mechanics of how the attacker accomplished this are unclear. 

Without more technical details from the post-mortem, there is not enough information provided in this write-up to determine the specifics of how the attack took place. The key phrase that sums this up is: "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place." More details are needed to analyze the vulnerability and exploit method.
