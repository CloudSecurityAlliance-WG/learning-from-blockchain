Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided in the markdown text, the attacker used a backdoor function in the DeFiLabs staking contract to drain user funds. Specifically:

- The vPoolv6 contract contained a withdrawFunds function that allowed the exploiter address (0xee08d6c3a983eb22d7137022f0e9f5e7d4cf0be2) to withdraw all user deposits from the contract.

- This is shown in the code snippet included, which has the withdrawFunds function allowing the owner (the exploiter address) to withdraw any token from the contract.

- Over $1.6 million in various tokens were drained from the contract via this withdrawFunds backdoor, including BSC-USD, CAKE, WBTC, WETH, and BUSD. 

- An example transaction showing the funds being withdrawn is also provided.

So in summary, the attacker exploited a withdrawFunds backdoor function intentionally left in the vPoolv6 staking contract by the DeFiLabs team, allowing them to rug user funds. No sophisticated hack was required since the contract functionality allowed the draining of deposits.
