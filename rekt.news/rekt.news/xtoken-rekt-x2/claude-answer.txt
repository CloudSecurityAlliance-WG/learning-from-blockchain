Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to determine exactly how the attack took place. 

The key details that are provided are:

1) The attacker used a flash loan to obtain a large amount of ETH.

2) The attacker then borrowed a large amount of SNX tokens from Aave and Bancor.

3) The attacker swapped the borrowed SNX tokens for USDC, which lowered the price of SNX significantly. 

4) The attacker then took advantage of the lower SNX price to repay sUSD debts in the xSNXAdmin contract and unlock SNX tokens, extracting their value.

5) This was made possible by the xSNXAdmin contract having an erroneous require statement that allowed the callFunction function to be called by anyone, not just the intended dydx SoloMargin contract.

So in summary, the core vulnerability was the erroneous require statement in the xSNXAdmin contract that allowed the attacker to exploit the contract's logic and extract value. But beyond that, there are not enough technical specifics provided to determine the exact sequence of transactions/calls that enabled the attack.
