Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack. 

The text mentions that the incident was due to the "improper use of a complex exponentiation power() function behind the calculation and enforcement of the weighted constant product invariant", but does not provide specifics on how this power() function was improperly used or what the vulnerability was.

It also states that "Any pool which did not have its liquidity split 50/50 between assets was exploited" and that "Since Uniswap only supports pools with a 50/50 asset ratio, Value DeFi used the Bancor formula for their non-standard pools." This suggests the issue may have had to do with supporting non-standard, imbalanced liquidity pools, but again no technical details are provided about the vulnerability itself.

Without more code examples or specifics on how the power() function and Bancor formula were implemented and misused, there is not enough information to determine the precise vulnerability the attacker leveraged. The text makes clear an exploit happened due to an improper use of a function for calculating the invariant, but does not contain enough technical information about the nature of that vulnerability or weakness in the contract.
