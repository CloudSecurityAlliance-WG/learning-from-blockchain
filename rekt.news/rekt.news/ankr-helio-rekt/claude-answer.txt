Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a compromised private key:

The exploit was due to a private key compromise of the Ankr deployer address on BSC, potentially the result of a phishing campaign.

The compromised deployer account published a malicious version of the aBNBc token contract, which was then upgraded to replace the existing implementation. 

So the attacker gained access to Ankr's deployer private key, likely through phishing. This gave them access to publish a malicious contract and upgrade the existing aBNBc token contract to include a backdoor minting function. This allowed them to freely mint a massive number of tokens to drain value from the project.

The post mortems from Peckshield and Beosin had warned about the risks from privileged accounts in the contracts, but Ankr unfortunately did not fix these issues. This allowed the attacker to exploit the deployer account once they had compromised its private key.

In summary, the attack vector was:

1. Compromise Ankr deployer private key (likely via phishing)
2. Use key to publish and upgrade malicious token contract 
3. Add minting backdoor to new contract
4. Freely mint tokens and extract value

So the root cause was the private key compromise, which then enabled access to critically sensitive permissions in the contracts.
