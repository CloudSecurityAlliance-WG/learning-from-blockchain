Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it appears the attacker exploited a vulnerability with the price oracle used by the Deus Finance lending contract. Specifically:

- The Deus lending contract uses the Solidex USDC/DEI pool as a price oracle to determine the collateral value of loans
- The attacker took out a flash loan of 24,772,798 DEI tokens from this USDC/DEI pool
- By borrowing this large amount of DEI, the attacker was able to temporarily manipulate the price of the DEI/USDC pair 
- This manipulated price made many users' collateral insolvent according to the lending platform's calculations
- The attacker's contract then liquidated these newly insolvent positions 
- After liquidating positions and profiting ~$3M, the attacker repaid the flash loan

So in summary, the vulnerability was the lending platform's reliance on a manipulable price oracle that could be exploited using a flash loan to artificially change asset prices. More robust, decentralized price oracle solutions may have prevented this attack.
