Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the main vulnerability exploited was the ability for the attacker to manually update the price feed for the wrapped ALBT (WALBT) collateral asset using the Tellor oracle. Specifically:

1. The attacker staked 10 TRB tokens worth about $175 to meet the minimum staking requirement for submitting price updates.

2. The attacker then called the submitValue function of the TellorFlex contract to submit a hugely inflated price for WALBT (50000000000000000000000000000000 according to the report). 

3. Because BonqDAO uses the instant reported value from the Tellor oracle rather than a time-averaged price, this immediately updated the collateral value. 

4. The attacker then borrowed 100M BEUR stablecoins against just 0.1 WALBT collateral due to the inflated collateral price.

5. In a follow up transaction, the attacker reset the WALBT price extremely low, allowing them to liquidate other users' WALBT collateral for a low cost.

In summary, the main issues were:

- The Tellor oracle allowed the attacker to manually set the price with a small stake rather than using an aggregated price feed.

- BonqDAO trusted the instant price from the oracle without additional validation. 

- This allowed the attacker to manipulate the collateral value to exploit the lending protocol.

The report provides clear technical details on how the attack took place via manipulating the Tellor oracle price feed. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
