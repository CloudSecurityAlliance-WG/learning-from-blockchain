<strong>~$48M CASHed out.</strong></p><p>The latest <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">leaderboard entry (#13)</a> comes from the Solana network, where an anonymous attacker used an infinite mint to make Cashio print faster than the Fed.</p><p>The exploit began at 08:15 UTC. At 09:59 UTC, Cashio made their <a href="https://twitter.com/CashioApp/status/1506571243067224064">announcement:</a></p><blockquote><p>Please do not mint any CASH. There is an infinite mint glitch.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We are investigating the issue and we believe we have found the root cause. Please withdraw your funds from pools. We will publish a postmortem ASAP.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/03/cashio-cg.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>Hyperinflation on a crypto timeframe.</strong></p><p><em>At least their tagline was accurate.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/03/cashio-brr.png"/></figure></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><em>Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1506578902331768832">samczsun,</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/madergaser">@madergaser,</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/siintemal">@siintemal.</a></em></p><p><strong>The root of the infinite mint vulnerability was Cashio’s incomplete collateral validation system.</strong></p><p>Before accepting tokens as collateral to mint CASH, the contract checks that the tokens to be deposited are correct (the same type of token that the contract holds).</p><p>However, the validation of the LP tokens to be deposited via <em>saber_swap.arrow</em> is incomplete, as the <em>.mint</em> field is never validated.</p><p>This results in the hacker being able to <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/3t1zqtKk4CgCk5ZDZMGSwdfvvWPekyQ5r8Prhk9MiR5Sw8vujCnFBncAuFCttw3oXzacMRH9ud3VY5virUY2Z39y">create a fake root contract</a>, which is never validated, and then a chain of fake accounts which each pass validation checks as they are compared only to one another.</p><p><strong>UPDATE (25/03/2022): The hacker also bypassed <em>depositor_source</em> via a similar mechanism, creating a false bank in order to pass the <em>common.collateral</em> verification. <a href="https://twitter.com/samczsun/status/1507056110934511619?s=28">Full details here.</a></strong></p><p>The hacker was therefore able to use their token as collateral to <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/2X1TKidhbocN5HRLVWRUk8W1YSQH9b6VH7biAm1ad5jwTZNrPSxajz2cyorrvqtUbWUAmCb52Yqk8VxYF2P6H5tP">mint 2B $CASH.</a></p><p>Part of the funds were then <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/4g5okypEDK9xdDwcootYz86uzTXm41VX7WosiJETGisiG2XpvNgT59djDiD2vwstQtCFF9bqSnViYJGF9Z9QrUvV">burned</a> for SaberSwap LP tokens which were <a href="https://solscan.io/tx/pjUgAeUfWaSSJuw2Cq1cQ9gHNWs8jkxJMtHqVAMuwhg3Uk9LN9Y2obfwt6Qm8bztg56xidWBMytzmqyWzvbsrwH">cashed out</a> for 10.8M UST and 16.4M USDC, and the remaining 1.97B CASH were swapped for 8.6M UST and 17M USDC on SaberSwap.</p><p>The majority of funds were bridged back to Ethereum, and swapped for &gt;16k ETH (~$48M) which remains in <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x86766247ba3405c5f15f06b895294200809e9cfb">this wallet.</a></p><p><strong>Following the attack, the exploiter’s <a href="https://solscan.io/account/6D7fgzpPZXtDB6Zqg3xRwfbohzerbytB2U5pFchnVuzw">SOL address</a> emitted hundreds of transactions of relatively small amounts of USDC to different addresses.
