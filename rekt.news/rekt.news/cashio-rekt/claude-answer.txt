Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the root cause of the vulnerability that enabled the infinite mint attack on Cashio was an incomplete validation system for collateral deposits. Specifically:

- Cashio's contract only validated that collateral token deposits were the same type of tokens held by the contract, but did not validate the ".mint" field of LP tokens deposited via the saber_swap.arrow contract.

- This allowed the hacker to create a fake root contract and a chain of fake token accounts that would pass the incomplete validation checks.

- The hacker was then able to use their fake tokens as collateral to mint a massive amount of CASH tokens.

So in summary, the lack of proper validation of the collateral token contract's minting mechanism enabled the attack. The hacker exploited this by creating fake token contracts that appeared valid to the incomplete validation logic.
