They added:</p><blockquote><p>we believe that discontinuing our services is in the best interest of our users and the protection of their funds.</p></blockquote><p>However, the protocol remained live, with the UI even paid up in advance for two years. As stated in the post:</p><blockquote><p>the only way to make changes or turn things off will have to be done through the governance.</p></blockquote><p><em>Foreshadowing?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p>Credit: <em><a href="https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1667790289946435584">Beosin</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/numencyber/status/1667582488338890752">Numen Cyber</a></em></p><p>The attack had been <a href="https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1667790306627162117">attempted</a> on the 12th of April, but it failed to pass.
