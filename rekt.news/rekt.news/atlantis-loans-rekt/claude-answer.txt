Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the attacker exploited the Atlantis Loans decentralized governance system to gain control of the protocol's token contracts. Specifically:

1) The Atlantis Loans developers abandoned the project in April 2022, but left the protocol operational. This included paying for the UI hosting for 2 years.

2) On June 7th, the attacker submitted a malicious governance proposal #52. 

3) The proposal granted the attacker control of Atlantis Loans' token contracts. 

4) After the proposal passed, the attacker upgraded the token contracts with their own malicious versions. 

5) These malicious contracts allowed the attacker to drain tokens from any address that still had active approvals to the old Atlantis Loans contracts.

So in summary, the vulnerability was the abandoned decentralized governance system that could still be abused to pass control to the attacker. The attacker then used this control to deploy malicious contracts and drain funds from unsuspecting users who still had active token approvals.

The key weaknesses were:

- Lack of ongoing maintenance/monitoring of the abandoned governance system
- Users not revoking approvals after Atlantis Loans was abandoned
- No security measures like time delays on governance proposals

Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
