Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited several vulnerabilities in Mango Markets:

1. Low liquidity and volume of the MNGO token allowed the attacker to easily manipulate the price by taking a large position and countertrading against it from another account. This spiked the price from $0.03 to $0.91.

2. The attacker used the unrealized profit from the pumped up MNGO position as collateral to drain lending pools and borrow assets, leaving Mango Markets with $115M in bad debt. 

3. The attacker acquired 32M Mango Markets governance tokens, which gave them a lot of voting power. They used this power to create a proposal demanding a $65M "bounty" in return for returning some funds and not pursuing criminal charges.

So in summary, the attack exploited:

- Illiquidity of the MNGO token
- Using unrealized P&L as collateral 
- Centralized governance power of the governance tokens

The write-up indicates the issue was raised months ago but not adequately addressed. There seems to be enough technical detail provided to determine how the attack took place. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
