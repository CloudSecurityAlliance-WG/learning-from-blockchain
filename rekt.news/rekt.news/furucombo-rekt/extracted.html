I opened TG from mobile to see what's up and saw from <a href="https://twitter.com/Darrenlautf">Darren's</a> <a href="https://t.me/thedailyape">"The daily ape"</a> channel that there was a Furucombo related exploit.</p><p>I checked one of my addresses I had used furucombo from and noticed the transfer of my aAAVE and some aETH.</p><p>I got scared because I had some active loans and didn't want to have my deposits liquidated. I found out that my health factor had dropped to 1.15, so i repaid the loans fast.</p><p>What i noticed is that the attacker drained all my aAAVE but only 1/3 of my aETH. I suspect that the low HF blocked them from transferring more funds out. I might have been lucky having active loans.</p><p>After I repaid the loans to protect the deposits, I revoked all token permissions I had given from that address.</p><p>That was an action I was postponing for weeks (for when fees would be lower). Apparently it was a costly delay.</p><p>I noticed the transfer of my funds by the hacker 90m after the hack had taken place.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>Was it a big loss for you?</em></p><p><em>How did it feel psychologically, do you feel more cautious or less confident about using DeFi after the attack?</em></p><p><strong>Limzero:</strong></p><p>It was a big loss in absolute numbers but nothing my portfolio couldn't survive.</p><p>I got very scared for a couple of minutes as I was afraid that all my aTokens could have gotten liquidated, when I saw my health factor above 1.1 I felt relief.</p><p>I treat the whole experience as an expensive security lesson- having infinite allowances on from an address with large amounts was a very silly mistake by my side. All things considered, that was an <a href="https://rekt.eth.link/ape-tax/">ape tax</a> I had to pay eventually. It's the first smart contract hack / exploit that affects me after so many years in the space. I feel lucky that more serious situations haven't touched me yet.</p><p>Actually the first exploit after the COVER exploit but I forgot about that :P</p><p>I do not feel less confident about using DeFi. These kinds of risks were known.</p><p>I have taken measures to increase my cyber security though.</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>What can you tell us about these measures?</em></p><p><strong>Limzero:</strong></p><p>I'd rather not say sorry.</p><p>It's part of the measures  üòã</p><p><strong>rekt:</strong></p><p><em>What steps would you recommend our readers take to improve their security?</em></p><p><strong>Limzero:</strong></p><ol><li>use hardware wallets</li><li>avoid windows</li><li>web 3 dedicated machine for contract interactions</li><li>unique passwords or password managers + VPN</li><li>low social media profile</li><li>use multiple addresses to spread risk</li><li>fresh addresses for new farms</li><li>revoke approvals from frequently used addresses</li></ol><p>I am not a security expert by any means.

So their scenario that furucombo team has provided is accessing the compound protocol using a compound adapter with proxy, that‚Äôs all.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>But, as you know, the exploit was caused by the scenario of using AAVE.
