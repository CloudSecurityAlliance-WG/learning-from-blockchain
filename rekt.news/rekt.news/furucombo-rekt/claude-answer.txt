Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in how Furucombo's proxy contract interacted with other DeFi protocols like Aave. Specifically:

- Furucombo's proxy contract allowed users to specify "handlers" (other contracts) that it would delegatecall to. This exposed Furucombo's proxy storage to be modified by these handlers.

- One of the allowed handlers was the Aave protocol's proxy contract. This contract had a function to set its own implementation address that is delegatecalled.

- The attacker created a malicious contract and used it to set the implementation address stored in Furucombo's proxy to point to their exploit contract instead of the real Aave contract. 

- When users later interacted with Furucombo, it would delegatecall to the Aave proxy contract, which would then delegatecall to the attacker's exploit contract instead of the real Aave due to the changed implementation address.

- The exploit contract was then able to steal funds that users had approved for the Furucombo proxy to access.

So in summary, the vulnerability was:

1. Furucombo's proxy allowed unchecked write access to its storage via delegatecalls to whitelisted handlers
2. One of those handlers (Aave) had a function to write to its own storage that was exposed via delegatecall
3. The attacker abused this to hijack control flow and steal funds

By allowing such broad delegatecall capabilities to a whitelisted set of contracts, Furucombo effectively gave up control of the security of their proxy contract if any of those whitelisted contracts were vulnerable.
