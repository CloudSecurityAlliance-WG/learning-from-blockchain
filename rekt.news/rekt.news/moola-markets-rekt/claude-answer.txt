Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a price manipulation vulnerability to drain funds from the Moola Market lending protocol. Specifically:

1. The attacker supplied 60k CELO worth ~$180k as collateral to borrow a large amount of the protocol's native token, MOO.

2. Using their remaining CELO, the attacker then pumped the price of MOO on a DEX (Ubeswap). 

3. With MOO's price artificially inflated, the attacker's MOO collateral was valued much higher. They likely had their collateral reappraised to reflect this.

4. The attacker then used their inflated collateral to borrow the rest of the assets from the protocol - 8.8M CELO, 765k cEUR, 1.8M MOO, and 644k cUSD - draining its liquidity.

In summary, the attacker was able to exploit the fact that MOO was used as a collateral asset to artificially boost their borrowing power and drain funds. This highlights the risks of using volatile native tokens as collateral.

The write-up provides clear details around the price manipulation strategy used, so there is enough information to determine how the attack took place.
