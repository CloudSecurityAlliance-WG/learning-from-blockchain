Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was the RocketSwap team storing private keys on their server, which were then compromised via a brute force attack:

"A brute force hack of the server was detected, and due to the proxy contract used for the farm contract, there were multiple high-risk permissions that led to the transfer of the farm's assets."

The attackers were able to steal the private keys and use them to drain RocketSwap's farming contracts. 

Storing keys on a server, especially unencrypted, is a major security risk. Private keys should be kept offline and properly secured. A brute force attack was able to compromise these keys.

So in summary, the vulnerability was:

1. Private keys stored unsecured on a server 
2. Allowing a brute force attack to obtain the keys
3. Keys then used to drain farming contracts

There appears to be enough detail provided to determine how the attack took place. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
