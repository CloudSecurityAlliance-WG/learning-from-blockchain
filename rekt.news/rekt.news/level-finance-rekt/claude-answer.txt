Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to execute their attack was:

**A missing check in the claimMultiple function of the LevelReferralControllerV2 contract that would have prevented referral reward claims from reusing the same epoch.**

Specifically:

- The LevelReferralControllerV2 contract handled referral rewards for Level Finance.

- The claimMultiple function in this contract did not contain a check to prevent referral claims from reusing the same epoch. 

- The attacker was able to prepare the attack by creating many referrals and using flash loans to increase their reward tier.

- They then exploited the lack of an epoch reuse check in claimMultiple to repeatedly claim referral rewards for the same epoch, draining 214k LVL tokens worth $1.1M.

So in summary, the specific vulnerability was the lack of an epoch reuse check in the claimMultiple function of the LevelReferralControllerV2 contract.
