Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a misconfiguration in the yUSDT token contract deployed by Yearn Finance over 3 years ago. Specifically:

1. The yUSDT token generated yield by investing in a basket of yield-bearing assets, including a USDT position on Fulcrum. However, the contract incorrectly contained the address of Fulcrum's USDC contract instead of the USDT contract.

2. The attacker was able to manipulate the share prices of the assets underlying yUSDT by exploiting this misconfiguration. 

3. By manipulating the share prices, the attacker was able to mint a large amount (1.2 quadrillion) of yUSDT tokens using just 10k USDT as collateral. 

4. The attacker then swapped the minted yUSDT for other stablecoins totaling $11.4 million.

In summary, the vulnerability was a misconfigured contract address in the old yUSDT token contract, which the attacker exploited to manipulate asset share prices and mint a massive number of tokens with little collateral. This allowed them to extract $11.4 million in funds. The analysis provides clear technical details on each step of the attack.
