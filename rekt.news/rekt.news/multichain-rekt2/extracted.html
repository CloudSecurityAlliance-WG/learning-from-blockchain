total of $126M, representing around 50% of the <a href="https://debank.com/profile/0xc564ee9f21ed8a2d8e7e76c085740d5e4c5fafbe">FTM bridge</a> and 80% of the <a href="https://debank.com/profile/0x10c6b61dbf44a083aec3780acf769c77be747e23">Moonriver bridge</a> holdings.</strong></p><p><strong>The project has quite the record…</strong></p><p>Before re-branding to Multichain, Anyswap was <a href="https://rekt.news/anyswap-rekt/">hacked for $8M</a> almost two years ago.</p><p>Then, in early 2022, <a href="https://medium.com/multichainorg/action-required-critical-vulnerability-for-six-tokens-6b3cbd22bfc0">six multi-token contracts</a> were found to be vulnerable to an <a href="https://www.halborn.com/blog/post/explained-the-multichain-hack-january-2022">approvals draining attack</a>, estimated to have led to $3M in user losses.</p><p>Finally, in May of this year, Multichain caused <a href="https://protos.com/rumors-prompt-panic-over-1-5b-blockchain-bridge-multichain/">panic</a> when responding to bridging delays, potential insider dumping and team arrest rumours, <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1661443109019062272">explaining</a> things away with a vague, but foreboding, “<em>force majeure</em>”.</p><p><strong>This time, <a href="https://twitter.com/MultichainOrg/status/1677096839731097600">comms</a> were equally worrying:</strong></p><blockquote><p>The lockup assets on the Multichain MPC address have been moved to an unknown address abnormally.</p><p>The team is not sure what happened and is currently investigating.</p><p><strong>It is recommended that all users suspend the use of Multichain services and revoke all contract approvals related to Multichain.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Fantom, which is heavily reliant on Multichain versions of many non-native assets (USDC, USDT, DAI, wETH and wBTC), also <a href="https://twitter.com/FantomFDN/status/1677055684716683264">didn’t have any answers</a>.</p><p><strong>With such a long and chequered history, and still no definitive root cause identified by the team…</strong></p><p><em>Is this just another of Cronje’s test-in-prod experiments gone wrong?</em></p><p><em>The largest rug we’ve ever seen?</em></p><p><em>Or even a very shy
