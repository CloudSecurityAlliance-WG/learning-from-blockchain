Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no definitive details disclosed on exactly how the attacker gained access and was able to drain funds from Multichain. 

The article states:

"While the exact attack vector is still to be determined, the[behaviour](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1677281092116840448) of transactions appear to suggest that an attacker was able to control the addresses directly."

It then provides some plausible methods for how the attacker may have gained access:

"Plausible [methods](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1677281299860709377) of gaining access include a back-end breach, obtaining private keys via spearphishing or the actions of a malicious insider."

However, there is no confirmation presented on which, if any, of these methods were actually used. 

The article also notes that the funds have not been moved since being drained, potentially indicating the actions of a whitehat hacker rather than a malicious attacker.

So in summary, there is not enough definitive information provided to determine exactly how the attack took place. The key phrase that sums this up is:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place"
