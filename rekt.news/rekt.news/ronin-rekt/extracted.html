A gas-free RPC node was established to ease costs for users during a period of heavy network traffic in which the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/axie-infinity">AXS price</a> peaked.</strong></p><p>This required Axie DAO approving Sky Mavis validators to sign transactions on their behalf.</p><p>Despite the arrangement only lasting until the following month, the whitelist access was never revoked, allowing the attacker who had compromised Sky Mavis validators to use the additional (Axie DAO) signature necessary to approve transactions.</p><p>The <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x098b716b8aaf21512996dc57eb0615e2383e2f96">attacker</a> then authorised two withdrawals, draining first <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc28fad5e8d5e0ce6a2eaf67b6687be5d58113e16be590824d6cfa1a94467d0b7">173,600 ETH</a> and then <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xed2c72ef1a552ddaec6dd1f5cddf0b59a8f37f82bdda5257d9c7c37db7bb9b08">25.5M USDC</a> from the Ronin <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x1a2a1c938ce3ec39b6d47113c7955baa9dd454f2">Bridge contract</a>.
