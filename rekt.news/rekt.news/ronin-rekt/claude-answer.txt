Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine how the attacker executed their attack. 

The text mentions that:

- The Ronin network uses 9 validators in a proof-of-authority model, where 5 out of 9 validators are needed to approve transactions. 

- 4 of the validators are operated by Sky Mavis.

- In November 2021, an arrangement was made for the Axie DAO validator to also sign transactions on Sky Mavis' behalf to provide a gas-free RPC node. This whitelist access was never revoked.

- The attacker compromised the Sky Mavis validators in some unspecified way.

- Using the compromised Sky Mavis validators plus the Axie DAO validator (which still had signing privileges), the attacker was able to authorize withdrawals draining 173,600 ETH and 25.5M USDC from the Ronin Bridge contract.

However, there are no technical details provided on exactly how the Sky Mavis validators were compromised. The text states "the official Community Alert doesn't give details on how the Sky Mavis validators were compromised." Without knowing how the validators were actually hacked, it's impossible to fully determine the specific vulnerability exploited by the attacker.

So in summary - while the text explains how the attacker was able to leverage the excess signing privileges of the Axie DAO validator to approve fraudulent transactions after compromising the Sky Mavis nodes, it does not contain enough technical information to conclusively ascertain the initial attack vector used to hack the Sky Mavis validators themselves.
