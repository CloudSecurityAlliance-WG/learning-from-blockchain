Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a rounding error in the interest rate calculation logic of the Midas lending protocol. 

Specifically, the article mentions:

"The exploit was made possible due to a rounding vulnerability in the redeem counter, affecting interest rate calculation (as in Aprilâ€™s [Hundred Finance](https://rekt.news/hundred-rekt2/) incident)."

And shows the following code snippet as an example:

```
uint256 roundedValue = value.div(100).mul(100);
```

This code is rounding the `value` variable to the nearest hundred. The attacker was somehow able to manipulate this rounding in a way that allowed them to redeem more funds from the lending pool than they should have been able to.

The same vulnerability has affected other protocols like Hundred Finance and Tropykus recently. So it seems to be a known issue that has propagated through copied and forked code in DeFi.

Based on the details provided, this rounding/precision error in the interest calculation logic was the specific vulnerability that enabled the $600k exploit of the Midas protocol. There are enough technical details provided to determine this.
