Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack on Dego Finance. 

The text states that Dego Finance claimed this was a case of "compromised keys", but does not provide any details about how the attacker actually gained access to or compromised those keys. 

Some possibilities that could lead to compromised keys include:

- A weakness or vulnerability in the key management system used by Dego Finance that allowed the attacker to steal private keys
- Social engineering attacks that tricked a Dego Finance developer or team member into giving up private keys
- Malware or other intrusion that gained access to Dego Finance's systems and stole private keys
- Insider threat from a malicious employee or developer with access to private keys

Without more technical details about the attack vector, the specific vulnerability exploited is unclear. The text does point out Dego Finance's lack of multi-signature schemes to protect keys as a weakness. But the root cause that allowed the attacker initial access is not provided.

In summary, there is insufficient information in the text to determine the specific vulnerability the attacker leveraged to compromise Dego Finance's keys and drain funds. More details would be needed to understand how access was first gained.
