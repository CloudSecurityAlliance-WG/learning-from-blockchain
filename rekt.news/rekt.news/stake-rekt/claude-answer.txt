Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it appears the attacker compromised the private keys to Stake's hot wallets on Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC blockchains, enabling them to drain funds directly. 

Specifically:

- Transactions were simple transfers from Stake's known hot wallet addresses, suggesting their private keys were compromised rather than a smart contract vulnerability being exploited.

- Over $41 million in native tokens and stablecoins were drained from these hot wallets and distributed to attacker addresses. 

- Stake's hot wallet addresses show no outgoing transfers for several hours after, indicating withdrawals are currently suspended.

The article suggests funds were centralized into these vulnerable hot wallets "behind a single set of private keys", but there are no further technical details provided on precisely how the private keys were compromised. 

So in summary, it was likely an operational security failure that allowed the attacker to gain access to and steal/transfer the private keys rather than a technical vulnerability being exploited. But the exact method used to obtain the keys is not detailed with the information provided.
