Then <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1698712407177150729">came another</a> round of transactions, with a further $25.6M lost on BSC and Polygon.</p><p>The platform took four and a half hours (or just three, according to Stake themselves) to publish an <a href="https://twitter.com/Stake/status/1698746766076588057">acknowledgment</a>, despite managing to put out a tone-deaf <a href="https://twitter.com/Stake/status/1698715792718901561">promo</a> tweet in the meantime.</p><p><strong>However, the announcement fails to mention the transactions on Polygon, or address <a href="https://twitter.com/spreekaway/status/1698700572784820533">reports</a> that user withdrawals are currently suspended.</strong></p><p><em>After another four hours, the team <a href="https://twitter.com/Stake/status/1698809658742637022">tweeted again</a>, informing users that deposits and withdrawals had resumed.</em></p><p>Surely $41M must be a drop in the ocean for Stake, with co-founder Bijan Tehrani earlier <a href="https://twitter.com/BijanTehrani/status/1698730623152664644">stating</a> that there would be no impact on customer funds.</p><p><em>So why the delay, and

to a largely normie audience.</strong></p><p><em>And for <a href="https://twitter.com/tayvano_/status/1698721766292811898">washing</a> scammers’ loot, of course… just like a real casino.</em></p><p>Rollbit may have been making more noise recently thanks to its <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/rollbit-coin">pumping</a> token, but Stake is clearly doing <a href="https://twitter.com/StakeEddie/status/1604073814354448384">just fine</a>, making enough to buy a <a href="https://www.casino.org/news/worlds-biggest-cypro-betting-site-founder-just-bought-a-28m-mansion/">$28M mansion</a> last year.</p><p><em>Aussie crypto founders certainly know how to cash out.</em></p><p><strong>But with Stake’s main fanboy Bitboy out of the picture so recently, the timing certainly seems coincidental.</strong></p><p>Then again, anyone <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1656021525470879774">trading shitcoins</a> via Metamask is probably not the type to pull off a multimillion dollar hack...</p><p><strong>Stake may be a casino but, ultimately, this story is the same as a large number of CEX hacks we've covered over the last few years.</strong></p><p>DeFi might have a reputation for incidents of this size, and looking at the <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a> it'd be hard to argue that it was undeserved.</p><p><strong>But centralised platforms should be held to a higher standard.</strong></p><p>DeFi protocols are open books, where permissions, privileges, and source code are published so users can DYOR.</p><p>Where are CeFi's disclosures of who has access to private keys within their systems? Some may argue that this would pose a risk of individuals being targeted for phishing campaigns (or worse).</p><p><em>So should they overhaul their entire infrastructure?</em></p><p><strong>Tens of millions held in hot wallets behind a single set of private keys...</strong></p><p><em>How many more ‘coincidences’ can we take?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
