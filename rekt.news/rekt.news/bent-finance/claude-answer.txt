Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability exploited was the ability for the Bent Finance team to manually adjust balances in the rewards contract. Specifically:

"Bent Finance [cvxCRV contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x270b6aff561284ef380cdd6d8b036f4981049a86) was [updated](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf711641ea9814d78780c8a51ad734ad44d58baf3f97256a3f5ec3200a29eadc7) on Nov. 30, manually adjusting the balance of the exploiterâ€™s [address.](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd23cfffa066f81c7640e3f0dc8bb2958f7686d1f)"

This allowed the exploiter to assign themselves "enormous amounts of rewards, far exceeding the TVL of Bent Finance itself."

So in summary, the vulnerability was the centralized ability for the Bent Finance team to manually adjust balances. This seems to point to an inside job rather than a technical smart contract exploit.
