Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack. 

The post-mortem states that the attacker:

1. Made a small deposit into a Bunny Vault
2. Made a large deposit directly to the MiniChefV2 (SushiSwap) contract
3. Called the withdrawAll function to execute the attack, using the amount deposited in MiniChefV2 as interest.

However, there are no technical details provided on the specific vulnerability in the contracts or protocols that enabled this attack. 

Without more code snippets, function details, or specifics on how the deposit/withdraw mechanism was exploited, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability. The post references it as a "loophole" but does not elaborate on what that loophole was from a technical perspective.

So in summary:

There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place from a technical point of view. More code-level details would be needed to understand the specific vulnerability.

Please let me know if any additional attack specifics or contract details can be provided. I'm happy to re-analyze with more information.
