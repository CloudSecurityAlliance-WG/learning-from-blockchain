Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability utilized by the attacker was the ability to artificially inflate the reward balance of the vault contract by sending it CAKE tokens directly:

The key steps were:

2) Send 180 CAKE to the LINK-BNB Vault contract. (This artificially inflates the vault contract's balance)

3) Call getReward with the deposit to collect rewards based on the contract balance 

4) With the large CAKE balance, the contract returns a large reward amount

5) Repeat multiple times to drain significant value

So in summary, the attacker was able to artificially set the vault contract's balance to a high amount by sending CAKE tokens directly to it. This then allowed them to collect inflated rewards repeatedly by calling the getReward function. There was likely inadequate validation of the contract's balance before calculating & dispersing rewards.
