Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in SafeDollar's reward mechanism to manipulate the accSdoPerShare value. Specifically:

1) The attacker made an initial deposit into one of SafeDollar's Safe Farms to prepare for the attack. 

2) SafeDollar was incentivizing the PLX token and charging fees on PLX transfers. However, during withdrawal transactions, these fees were incorrectly deducted from the rewarder balance rather than the user balance. 

3) The attacker exploited this by depositing and immediately withdrawing PLX in a loop. Over 101 transactions, this gradually drained the PLX balance from the pool, resulting in the accSdoPerShare value becoming massively inflated.

4) With the rewards system now skewed in the attacker's favor, they claimed the rewards on their initial deposit. This produced an enormous amount of SDO tokens (831 quadrillion), which the attacker immediately sold, crashing the SDO price to $0.

5) Despite owning so many tokens, the attacker could only steal the pool's liquidity - 202k USDC and 46k USDT, for a total of around $248k. 

So in summary, the attacker gamed SafeDollar's broken fee and rewards system to produce a huge amount of otherwise worthless tokens, dump them on the market, and steal the collateral - ultimately proving SafeDollar was decidedly not safe.
