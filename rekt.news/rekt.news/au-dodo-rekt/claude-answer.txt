Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DODO V2 Crowdpooling smart contract that allows the init() function to be called multiple times. Here are the key steps the attacker took:

1. The attacker created a fake token and initialized the smart contract with it by calling init().

2. The attacker called sync() to set the token balance to 0. 

3. The attacker called init() again, this time with a real token from DODO's pools.

4. The attacker used a flash loan to drain all the real tokens from the pools and bypass the flash loan check.

The ability to call init() multiple times allowed the attacker to trick the contract into thinking the fake token was legitimate, then replace it with a real token and drain the pools. This was possible due to the contract not preventing multiple init() calls.

In summary, the vulnerability was the lack of validation around init() being called multiple times, which allowed the attacker to manipulate token balances and drain funds.
