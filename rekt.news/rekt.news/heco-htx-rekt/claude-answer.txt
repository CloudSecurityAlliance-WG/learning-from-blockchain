Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attacks on the HECO Chain's Ethereum bridge and the HTX hot wallets were carried out. 

The key pieces of information provided are:

- A compromised operator account was used to drain funds from the HECO Chain Ethereum bridge into an attacker's wallet. This indicates the bridge itself may not have had a direct vulnerability, but rather an operator account was compromised in some way.

- HTX hot wallets were directly drained into attacker wallets. This could indicate a vulnerability in the hot wallet systems was exploited to gain access.

However, there are no specifics given on:

- How the operator account was compromised - was their private key exposed? Did the attacker gain access through phishing or other means? 

- What vulnerability in the hot wallets, if any, was leveraged to drain the funds.

So unfortunately there is not enough technical detail here to determine the specific vulnerability or attack vector used. More investigation details from the affected parties would be needed to understand how these hacks were perpetrated.
