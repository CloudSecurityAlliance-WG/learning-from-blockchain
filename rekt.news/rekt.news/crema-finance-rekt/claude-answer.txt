Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was:

"The attack was made possible due to faulty owner validation on one of the protocol’s accounts storing price tick data. These data are used by Crema to calculate LP fees.

The hacker created a false tick account, with fake data, and used flash loans to add liquidity to the protocol. They could then withdraw the liquidity and claim the fees they were “owed” according to their own contract’s data."

So in summary:

1. There was insufficient validation of the price tick data accounts used to calculate LP fees. 
2. The attacker created a fake price tick account with false data.
3. The attacker used flash loans to add and withdraw liquidity, claiming excessive LP fees based on the false data in their fake account.

The key weaknesses were the lack of proper ownership and data validation on critical accounts used to determine LP fee payouts. This allowed the attacker to spoof data and claim fees they were not actually owed.

There appears to be enough technical detail provided to determine how the attack took place. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
