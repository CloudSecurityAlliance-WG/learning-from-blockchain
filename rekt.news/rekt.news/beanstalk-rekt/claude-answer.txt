Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the main vulnerability the attacker exploited was the ability to instantly execute a malicious governance proposal without any delay. Specifically:

1) The attacker prepared a malicious governance proposal (BIP-18) that would transfer all funds from the protocol to the attacker. This was made possible by the 1 day delay on governance actions, which allowed the proposal to be prepared in advance.

2) The attacker then used a flash loan to temporarily gain a majority of voting power in the protocol. This flash loan provided over $1 billion worth of assets that were added to liquidity pools with BEAN tokens to gain voting power.

3) With the temporary voting power, the attacker voted on and instantly executed the prepared BIP-18 proposal using the emergencyCommit function. This immediately transferred all funds (over $180 million) to the attacker.

4) The attacker then repaid the flash loans, kept $76 million in ETH, and sent the rest to Tornado Cash.

The key factors that enabled this attack were:

- Lack of a delay in executing governance proposals 
- Ability to temporarily gain voting power via flash loans
- Emergency commit functionality that allowed instant execution

The report does provide enough technical details to determine how the attack took place through the vulnerabilities described above. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
