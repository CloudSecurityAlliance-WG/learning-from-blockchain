Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact details of how the attack took place. The key details that are missing are:

1. Technical specifics on the vulnerability in the ECDSA implementation used by Anyswap's V3 router that allowed the attacker to back-calculate the private key. The writeup mentions that the issue was repeat k-values in signatures, but does not provide the vulnerable code or describe how the attacker was able to exploit this to obtain the private key.

2. How the attacker gained access to sign transactions with the compromised private key. The writeup shows the attacker draining funds after compromising the key, but does not describe how they signed the draining transactions. 

So in summary, while the writeup gives a high-level description of an ECDSA vulnerability being exploited to obtain a private key, and shows the aftermath of funds being drained, it does not provide the crucial technical details to understand exactly how the attack took place. More specific information about the vulnerable ECDSA implementation and how the attacker turned the compromised key into a loss of funds is needed.
