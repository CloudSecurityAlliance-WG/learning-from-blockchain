Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no technical details given about how the attack specifically took place. The article mentions:

- The protocol was a fork of Olympus
- $1.75 million was taken 
- Funds were transferred from the protocol to Tornado Cash for anonymity
- The developers falsely claimed to have multi-sig in place when they did not
- The developers may have posted private keys on Facebook or in a Google Doc
- Many are accusing the developers themselves of taking the funds 

However, there are no technical details provided on the specific vulnerability or exploit used to steal the funds. The article suggests it could have been due to poor operational security (OPSEC) by the developers, but does not confirm how the attack took place from a technical standpoint.

Given the lack of technical details on the attack vector, I cannot conclusively determine how the attack took place. The article suggests it was likely due to very poor security practices by the developers, but does not provide enough specific technical information to know for certain.
