Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the exploit utilized a reentrancy vulnerability due to the ERC-677 token standard used on the Fuse Network. Specifically:

1. The ERC-677 tokens implemented a `callAfterTransfer()` function that can be abused to make additional transfers before balances are updated. 

2. The underlying Compound-like lending protocol code followed an insecure sequence of execution where internal states were updated after an external call rather than before.

3. The attacker was able to:
   - Deposit ERC-677 wrapped tokens into the lending protocol
   - Borrow other tokens
   - When the borrowed tokens were transferred out, the `callAfterTransfer()` function was triggered, allowing the attacker to re-enter the protocol and drain additional funds before balances were updated

4. This allowed the attacker to repeatedly drain funds from the lending protocol by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.

In summary, the root cause was the combination of the ERC-677 token standard and non-adherence to checks-effects-interactions in the lending protocol's code, allowing a reentrancy attack during the token transfer process.
