Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the markdown text to determine exactly how the attack took place. 

The key pieces of information provided are:

- An attacker was able to mint 373 million new BONDLY tokens and dump them on the market, causing the price to crash.

- The minting happened from address 0x58a058ca4b1b2b183077e830bc929b5eb0d3330c. 

- Funds were then sent to Tornado Cash for mixing by address 0xc433d50dd0614c81ee314289ec82aa63710d25e8, which is presumed to be the attacker's wallet.

However, there are no details provided on the specific vulnerability or weaknesses in the Bondly Finance platform/contracts that enabled this attack. 

Some possibilities that could potentially explain it:

- A flaw in the token minting logic that allowed unlimited minting
- Compromise of an administrative key/account that was able to mint new tokens
- An access control issue that allowed the attacker to gain minting rights

But without further technical information on the Bondly contracts and architecture, there is not enough detail provided in the post to conclusively determine the exact attack vector utilized.
