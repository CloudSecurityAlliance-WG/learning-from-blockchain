<strong>In which Bondly battles the infinite mint.</strong></p><p>Founded in November 2020, Bondly Finance was a multi-service NFT platform.</p><p>Their token holders are now at a loss, due to an infinite mint exploit in which the attacker made a profit of $5.9 million.</p><p><strong>As always, this may have been a rug pull, but this was not just your standard foodcoin farm.</strong></p><p>Bondly had built up a decent following, with ~47k followers on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/BondlyFinance/status/1380466156344111104?s=20">investment</a> from Binance, and partnerships with reasonably sized celebrities.</p><p>Those celebrities included Logan Paul, whose brother Jake Paul was also affected by the <a href="https://www.rekt.news/chainswap-rekt/">Chainswap exploit</a> just days ago.</p><p><em>Influencers - rekt.</em></p><p>The Bondly Finance website details their work with the PolkaPets Trading Card Game, as well as their other work with digital collectibles, brands, influencers, and artists.</p><p>If you’re into that sort of thing, then by most measurements, Bondly were doing well.</p><p><strong>Now they are not.</strong></p><p>Mint address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x58a058ca4b1b2b183077e830bc929b5eb0d3330c">0x58a058ca4b1b2b183077e830bc929b5eb0d3330c</a></p><p>Associated wallet: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc433d50dd0614c81ee314289ec82aa63710d25e8">0xc433d50dd0614c81ee314289ec82aa63710d25e8</a></p><p>The market had no need for 373 million new BONDLY tokens, so when the <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xc433d50dd0614c81ee314289ec82aa63710d25e8#tokentxns">malicious actor</a> minted and began to dump 100,000 of them at a time, the <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bondly">price of BONDLY</a> fell by 80%.</p><p>$4.8 million DAI was sent to Tornado, and $1.1 million in DAI and BONDLY remains on the address at the time of writing.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/7/bondly-price.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>The Bondly <a href="https://twitter.com/BondlyFinance/status/1415543486141636612?s=20">announcement tweet</a> claims the wallet was compromised by an unknown party.</strong></p><p>Was it an external attacker, or the Bondly team, who took inspiration from the case of <a href="https://www.rekt.news/paid-rekt/">Paid Network?</a></p><p><em>How will Bondly recover from this incident?</em></p><p>Many protocols now attempt some form of compensation after an attack, but when we asked <a href="https://t.me/Rekt_HQ">our Telegram group</a> whether this should always be expected, our readers' feedback was not unanimous.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/7/bondly-vote.png"/></figure></p><p>With such an established userbase, it would be a shame if Bondly Finance, didn’t live to <em>die another day.</em></p><p>Although this is their first time on the <a href="https://www.rekt.news/leaderboard/">rekt leaderboard</a>(#28), we’ll <em>never say never again</em>, as DeFi is a <em>casino royale</em>, where the hackers don’t need a <em>licence to kill.</em></p><blockquote><p>From rekt.news with love.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-text-linebreak.png"/></figure></p>
