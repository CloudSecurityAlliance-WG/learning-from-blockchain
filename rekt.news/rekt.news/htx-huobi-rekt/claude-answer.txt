Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no technical details given about how the hack on the HTX (formerly Huobi) exchange was executed. 

The key pieces of information are:

- 4999 ETH ($7.9M) was drained from the exchange at 10AM UTC on Sunday
- The remaining 633 ETH ($1M) was secured by HTX a bit over 2 hours later
- HTX CEO Justin Sun claims the hacker has been identified but provides no proof
- Sun also claims HTX has "real-time monitoring mechanisms" in place now to prevent further losses

However, there is no description of:

- How the hacker gained access 
- What vulnerability or weaknesses were exploited
- How the funds were able to be drained
- Why the monitoring mechanisms were not in place before
- Technical details of the real-time monitoring now implemented

Without more specifics on the attack vectors, exploits used, or vulnerabilities present in HTX's systems, there is not enough information provided to determine how the attack took place.
