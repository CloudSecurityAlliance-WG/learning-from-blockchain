Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a lack of caller verification in the updated Single Pool Contract introduced by Gym Network. 

Specifically, the "Claim and Pool" feature did not properly verify the caller of the function, allowing the attacker to artificially inflate their balance without actually depositing any funds. The attacker was then able to withdraw this falsely credited balance, effectively stealing funds from the protocol.

The example exploit transaction shows the attacker calling a function in the vulnerable contract to falsely increase their balance. PeckShield confirms that the issue was due to missing caller verification that would have prevented this attack.

In summary, the attacker exploited a logic vulnerability in newly introduced code that allowed them to trick the contract into thinking they had deposited funds without actually spending anything. This demonstrates the risks involved when making changes to previously audited contracts.
