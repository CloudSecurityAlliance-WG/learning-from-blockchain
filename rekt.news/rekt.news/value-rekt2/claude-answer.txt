Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided in the post-mortem analysis, the vulnerability that enabled the exploit was due to a missing line of code in the initialize() function of the affected pool contract:

```
initialized = true;
```

This line sets a variable to mark that the contract has already been initialized. Without this line, the contract could be re-initialized by anyone, allowing the attacker to set themselves as the owner and take full control. 

As the new owner, the attacker called the governanceRecoverUnsupported() function to drain the pool's funds into their own wallet. They were then able to take the pooled assets, convert them to renBTC, and withdraw the Bitcoin to their own address.

So in summary, the attack was made possible due to a "human error" in migrating code from an old contract implementation to a new contract. A line to mark the contract as initialized after deployment was omitted, allowing the attacker to re-initialize as the owner to steal assets.
