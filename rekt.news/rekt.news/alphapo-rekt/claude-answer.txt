Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to conclusively determine how the attacker gained access to AlphaPo's hot wallet and drained the funds. 

The article speculates that the hack was likely carried out by the Lazarus cybercriminal group using spearphishing techniques, but does not provide any confirmed details on how they actually compromised AlphaPo's systems.

Some key phrases that indicate a lack of specific technical details:

-"The phishing techniques used by sophisticated groups like Lazarus are varied and ever-evolving"

-"Stories of compromised hot wallets leave little to be said"

- "But they always have a common goal"

So in summary, while the article analyzes the on-chain movement of the stolen funds, it does not reveal the specific vulnerability, exploit, or attack vector used to initially access the hot wallet and drain it. There simply is not enough technical information provided to make a definitive assessment.
