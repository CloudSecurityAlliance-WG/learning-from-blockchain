Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Gamma Strategies' configuration of price change thresholds for some liquidity pools. Specifically:

- Gamma had configured high price change thresholds (50-200%) for certain stablecoin/LST vaults. This allowed significant manipulation of asset prices within those pools.

- The attacker used flash loans to manipulate asset prices upwards within affected pools. By pushing prices up near the higher thresholds, the attacker was able to mint a disproportionately high number of LP tokens relative to the assets deposited. 

- The attacker then withdrew the inflated LP tokens to drain funds from the protocol.

So in summary, the vulnerability was improper configuration of price boundaries for some pools, which the attacker exploited using flash loan driven price manipulation to mint excess LP tokens and extract funds. The write-up indicates this occurred during the deposit process into affected vaults/pools.

The provided information seems sufficient to understand the core attack vector. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
