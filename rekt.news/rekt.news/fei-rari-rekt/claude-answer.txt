Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to drain funds from Rari's Fuse pools was a reentrancy issue due to the Compound protocol code used in these pools not following the check-effect-interaction pattern. Specifically:

- Rari uses forked Compound code in its Fuse pools that is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This code does not properly follow the check-effect-interaction pattern.

- The "borrow()" function in this Compound code transfers ETH to the attacker's contract before updating the attacker's actual borrow records.

- This allowed the attacker to make a reentrant call to the "exitMarket()" function via the fallback function after borrowing ETH but before the borrow record was updated. 

- The "exitMarket()" function allows the attacker to withdraw their deposited collateral (in this case 150M USDC).

- So the attacker was able to borrow ETH, withdraw their collateral due to the reentrancy, and keep the borrowed ETH, draining funds from the pools.

The step-by-step analysis shows how the attacker exploited this reentrancy vulnerability specifically using the "borrow()" and "exitMarket()" functions and the lack of proper checks before effects.
