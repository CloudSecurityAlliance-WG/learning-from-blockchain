Message:  Based on the details provided, the second exploit that drained almost $3 million from Stars Arena took advantage of a reentrancy vulnerability in the sellShares() function. 

Specifically, the attacker was able to insert a block height as the number of AVAX to send during the sellShares() call. This likely allowed them to extract more funds than intended and drain the contract balance.

The technical details suggest:

- There was a reentrancy vulnerability where the contract state was not updated before sending ETH/tokens
- The attacker was able to make a recursive call and pass an invalid parameter (block height instead of amount)
- This recursion allowed them to drain almost the entire contract balance

The write-up quotes Beosin saying "the attacker took advantage of a reentrancy vulnerability to insert a block height as the number of AVAX to send during the sellShares() function." This confirms the attack vector was reentrancy on the sellShares() function.

In summary, the attacker exploited a reentrancy bug, specifically in the sellShares() function, to drain almost $3 million from the contract. There are enough technical details provided to determine the vector used.
