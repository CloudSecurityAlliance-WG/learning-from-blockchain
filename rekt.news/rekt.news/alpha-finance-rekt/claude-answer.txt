Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately there is not enough technical information provided in the incident write-up to determine exactly how the attack took place from a coding perspective. 

The key points that can be gleaned are:

1) The attacker created a malicious "spell" (contract) that was able to manipulate debt calculations in the Alpha Homora protocol.

2) The attacker needed insider knowledge of an unreleased sUSD lending pool in the Alpha Homora V2 contracts in order to execute their attack. 

3) There was a rounding error in the borrow function calculation that the attacker was able to exploit by being the sole borrower.

4) The attacker was able to increase the total debt without increasing the total debt share using the resolveReserve function.

5) Through a complex series of transactions, the attacker was able to repeatedly borrow sUSD tokens without the protocol registering it as real debt due to the manipulated debt shares.

So in summary, it involved insider knowledge, a malicious contract, and manipulation of debt calculations/shares - but the exact vulnerability in the code is not specified. The write-up focuses more on the sequence of transactions than the coding details that enabled the attack. I cannot determine the precise vulnerability from the information provided.
