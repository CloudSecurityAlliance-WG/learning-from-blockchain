Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the article to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The article mentions that the attack involved:

- Using a flash loan to mint EMN tokens
- Manipulating the EMN price downwards by burning EMN tokens for eTokens
- Shorting EMN tokens by burning flashed EMN tokens back into DAI

However, it does not provide the smart contract code or explain the specific vulnerability that was exploited. 

Without more technical details about the contracts and transactions involved, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability that was used to drain the $15 million. The article focuses more on the aftermath and impact of the attack rather than the technical details.

So in summary - there is not enough information provided in this write-up to technically determine how the attack took place. More specifics around the contracts, transactions, and mechanics of the attack would be needed. But the article does suggest it involved flash loans, price manipulation, and shorting tokens in some capacity.
