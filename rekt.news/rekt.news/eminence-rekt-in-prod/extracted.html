Andre Cronje‚Äôs unreleased project Eminence has been hacked for $15 million.</p><p>The crypto community went into yet another frenzy last night, as Andre Cronje's unreleased project became the focus of hundreds of users, who quickly bought $15 million of the mysterious $EMN token.</p><p>After some unexplained promotional tweets, users were keenly watching Cronje's account for any clues as to what was coming. As soon as the new contracts were <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x2d407ddb06311396fe14d4b49da5f0471447d45c#tokentxns.">deployed </a>from the yEarn finance address, the game was on.</p><p>Hundreds of users joined in the crowd-sourced investigation project to try and understand what was going on, and how to profit.</p><p>Users linked the graphics from the eminence.finance Twitter account to an unfinished MMORG called Eminence, Xander's Tales.</p><blockquote><p><a href="https://t.co/tV9LSzPXlV">pic.twitter.com/tV9LSzPXlV</a> &gt; ‚Äî eminence.finance (@eminencefi) <a href="https://twitter.com/eminencefi/status/1310628912339316736?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2020</a></p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2020/09/xanders.png"/></figure></p><blockquote><p>You're hearing it here first, certified alpha leak, I smell the rebirth of an old card game with an NFT/DEFI twist... <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ENM&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ENM</a></p><p>Do some digging on "Eminence: Xander's Tales" and you'll find that <a href="https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AndreCronjeTech</a> even follows the lead artist for the project... üëÄ</p><p>More soon, follow me

These tokens, plus the surprise launch, matched perfectly one of Andre's previous tweets about the upcoming yEarn finance project.</p><blockquote><p>The new yearn system is probably the most complex to date.

Theories are running wild about who was behind the hack, and why they would return any money, ¬†with some pointing the finger at the creators of Yearn Finance, and claiming it was an inside job.</p><blockquote><p>So.. was it <a href="https://twitter.com/bantg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@bantg</a> who ran multiple bots, inflated the SHIT out of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EMN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#EMN</a> (and more) to arb DAI and eventually dumped for the growing liquidity?<a href="https://t.co/vKOKs7IlxF">https://t.co/vKOKs7IlxF</a><a href="https://t.co/rbb8H6c78H">https://t.co/rbb8H6c78H</a><a href="https://t.co/V7ocyAQg0J">https://t.co/V7ocyAQg0J</a><a href="https://twitter.com/ChainLinkGod?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ChainLinkGod</a><a href="https://twitter.com/AndreCronjeTech?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@AndreCronjeTech</a><a href="https://t.co/9Dle86Yffy">pic.twitter.com/9Dle86Yffy</a> &gt; ‚Äî Spicetoshi (@Spicetoshi) <a href="https://twitter.com/Spicetoshi/status/1310884921783787522?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2020</a></p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2020/09/andrechan.jpg"/></figure>
Ultimately, those who deposited funds into the unaudited contracts are responsible for the loss of their money, however many have branded Cronje's promotion of the unfinished contract to be irresponsible, as the resulting FOMO could have easily been predicted.</p><p>One thing is for certain, a lot of people lost money last night.</p><blockquote><p>Can we pour one out for our üêã whale brother here that spent $130,548 for <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EMN&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$EMN</a> 1.5 hours ago and just sold it recently for $368.<a href="https://t.co/5iVIHS93Pv">https://t.co/5iVIHS93Pv</a><a href="https://t.co/GBUMc62Eqs">https://t.co/GBUMc62Eqs</a><a href="https://t.co/jIa7WVwP6s">pic.twitter.com/jIa7WVwP6s</a> &gt; ‚Äî fomosaurus ü¶ñ (@fomosaurus) <a href="https://twitter.com/fomosaurus/status/1310761830353186816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2020</a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>FOLLOW UP POST: MANS SPENDS 100k TO MAKE $348 - MAD RESPECT TO THE GALAXY BRAIN DEGEN KING WHO RISKED IT ALL FOR AN ETH <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24EMN&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$EMN</a><a href="https://t.co/IZnBSTMfqs">pic.twitter.com/IZnBSTMfqs</a>
