<strong>They told us it was going to happen, then it did.</strong></p><p>A few hours before the attack, we received a direct message from an anonymous source suggesting that StableMagnet would rugpull.</p><p><em>We couldn’t verify the claims, and therefore our hands were tied.</em></p><p>If we had made a public warning and the accusations had been false, we would have caused FUD and potentially damaged an innocent project.</p><p>There was no scope to whitehack the funds, so all we could do was wait.</p><p>Now there’s $27 million gone, and more due to be stolen from the wallets of those who have not yet revoked permissions to StableMagnet.</p><p><strong>Users can use the <a href="https://t.co/n0q58A8gJ1?amp=1">BSC Token Approval Checker</a> to revoke these permissions.</strong></p><p>We were unable to stop this attack, and that knowledge is not easy to accept.
