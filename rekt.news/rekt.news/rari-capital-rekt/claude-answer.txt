Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack. 

The write-up provides a high-level overview of the attacker's actions, but does not give technical details on the specific vulnerability leveraged in the protocols attacked (Alpaca Finance, Alpha Homora, etc.).

Some key pieces of technical information that would be needed to analyze the vulnerability:

- Code snippets of the vulnerable functions/contracts in the protocols attacked
- Details on the specific payload/exploit code used to extract funds 
- More specifics on how the attack interacted with and manipulated the protocol to steal funds

Without those types of low-level technical details, it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise vulnerability. The write-up mentions the attack was “similar to the Evil Pickle Jar” technique, but more specifics would be needed to confirm if it was the exact same vulnerability replicated across chains or something different.

In summary, while the high-level steps of the attack are documented, there is not enough technical information provided here to determine the underlying vulnerability used to facilitate the attack. More code-level specifics would be needed for that analysis.
