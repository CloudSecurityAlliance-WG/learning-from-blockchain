Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, it appears the attacker exploited a rounding error vulnerability that exists when new markets are launched on forks of the Aave V2 lending protocol. 

Specifically:

- The issue affects newly launched markets, before any deposits have been made, when the totalSupply is 0.

- This allows the attacker to take out a flash loan, manipulate the collateral value due to the rounding error, and profit.

- The Aave protocol previously mitigated this by requiring an initial deposit when creating new markets. However, Radiant Capital's fork of Aave V2 did not include this fix.

- The attacker was prepared and deployed their attack contract just 6 seconds after the new USDC market was activated on Radiant.

So in summary, the attacker exploited the combination of:

1) A rounding error vulnerability 
2) An empty market (totalSupply = 0)
3) Lack of initial deposit mitigation

To execute a flash loan attack and steal funds through collateral manipulation.

The write-up provides detailed information on how the attack took place, so there is enough technical information provided.
