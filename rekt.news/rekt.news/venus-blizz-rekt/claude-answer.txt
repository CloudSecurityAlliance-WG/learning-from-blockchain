Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was an inaccurate Chainlink price feed for LUNA that was used by Venus Protocol and Blizz Finance. Specifically:

- The Chainlink price feed for LUNA had a hardcoded minimum price of $0.10. As the actual price of LUNA crashed below $0.10, this price feed remained at $0.10.

- This allowed attackers to buy large amounts of nearly worthless LUNA for the actual market price, but use it as collateral in Venus and Blizz as if it was still worth $0.10. 

- So the attackers were able to use this essentially worthless LUNA collateral to borrow funds from Venus and Blizz.

- Blizz Finance in particular was unable to react quickly enough to suspend activity, and its treasury was drained of the $8.3 million in funds that were lent out against the worthless LUNA collateral.

So in summary, the vulnerability was the inaccurate Chainlink LUNA price feed that remained at $0.10 even as the actual price crashed. This allowed attackers to exploit the difference between the real and reported price.
