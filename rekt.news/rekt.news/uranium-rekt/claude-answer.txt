Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to definitively determine how the attack took place. 

The key pieces of information provided are:

1) Uranium Finance copied code from Uniswap v2 for their UraniumPair contracts.

2) They changed some values from 1,000 to 10,000 in two places, but not a third place. Specifically:

```
- uint public constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 1000;
+ uint public constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10000;

- uint public constant MAXIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 1000; 
+ uint public constant MAXIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10000;

uint public constant price0CumulativeLast = 1000;
```

3) This "resulted in being able to swap 1 wei of the input token for 98% of the total balance of the output token."

However, there are no code snippets or further technical details explaining exactly how changing those constant values enabled draining the liquidity pools. 

Without more code or specifics on the vulnerability, I cannot confidently determine the exact attack vector. The article hints that it broke the Uniswap constant product formula check before updating balances, but does not show the code where this happened.

In summary, while the article provides some helpful clues, there is simply not enough technical information provided to fully explain the attack flow. Please let me know if you have or find any additional details that could help determine the vulnerability. Otherwise, the best I can say is that changing some constant values in the UraniumPair contracts somehow enabled draining the pools, but the exact mechanism is unclear.
