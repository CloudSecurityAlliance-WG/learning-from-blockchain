There are multiple bridges out of BSC now, and they’re not all controlled by Binance, meaning CZ can’t blacklist all the addresses and keep the stolen funds on BSC.</p><p>Attackers will steal on one chain and escape to another where they can’t be tracked so easily. Tornado is currently the only DAPP allowing for this kind of exit, but we’ll soon see clones on other chains.</p><p>The beneficiary of this incident is now sat on $57.2 million of liquid assets, a much more preferable prize than the <a href="https://www.rekt.news/easyfi-rekt/">EASY</a> tokens of our previous article, and one which places them in second place on our <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>.</p><p>Exploits and rug pulls will slow down, but they’re unlikely to stop completely. Even now, when we have battle tested code such as Curve and Uniswap, users still look to chase higher returns in untested projects, so for now, rug pulls look set to stay.</p><p>One day hackers will operate on fully private chains where they have no need to escape with their funds, but until then...</p><p><em>rekt will be watching.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/04/uran-conc.png"/></figure></p>
