Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, there does not seem to be enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place. 

The key phrases that indicate a lack of technical details are:

"The root cause of this incident was the use of AMM-based oracle (Uniswap), which allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of UniswapV2 pair (WETH-DAI) LP token."

This states the root cause but does not explain the specific vulnerability or how the manipulation occurred.

"An interesting point to note is that the attacker does not profit from this immediately."

This suggests the attack outcome is still uncertain or ongoing. More details would be needed to fully understand it.

"Though this incident leads to ~$7.8 million loss, the attacker does not immediately benefit from it."

Same as above - the end result for the attacker is still unclear.

The write-up focuses more on commentary about the state of DeFi and speculation about attacker motives rather than technical details of exactly how the attack was executed from start to finish. 

In summary, while it provides some helpful context, there is not enough specific technical information provided to determine conclusively how the attack took place. Please let me know if any additional details can be provided.
