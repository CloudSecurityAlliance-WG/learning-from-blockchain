Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to exploit the MEV bot was an unprotected swap function in the bot's code. Specifically:

"The botâ€™s code had left a swap function unprotected, which anyone could call. This was exploited to sandwich attack the bot via WETH/WBTC trades on Curve, funded via a $50M flash loan."

The attacker was able to call the unprotected swap function in the bot's contract. This allowed them to manipulate swaps on Curve pools that the bot was using. By pumping and dumping an asset price (WETH) through these swaps, the attacker was able to profit $2M from the bot.

The key pieces of information showing how the attack worked:

- Unprotected swap function in bot contract: "A bot was attacked due to the lack of access control of a public function 0xf6ebebbb, which could be exploited to manipulate swaps in Curve pools."

- Attacker called this function to manipulate WETH price on Curve

- Sandwich attacked the bot by pumping and dumping WETH to profit from the manipulated prices

So in summary, the vulnerability was an unprotected swap function that gave the attacker access to manipulate the bot's trading behavior on Curve. This allowed a sandwich attack that drained $2M from the bot.
