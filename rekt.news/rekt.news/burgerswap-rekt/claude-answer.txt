Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack on BurgerSwap. 

The write-up mentions that the attack was made possible because the attacker could do a reentrance attack and make a second swap before reserves were updated. This allowed the attacker to get more tokens out than they put in. However, the details of how the attacker was able to conduct the reentrance attack are not provided. 

The write-up also mentions that a check for x*y=k that is present in the UniSwap code was seemingly removed from the BurgerSwap code. The removal of this check would allow an attacker to trigger a swap of any output size while only paying a small input. However, there are no code snippets or other technical specifics showing exactly where or how this check was removed from the BurgerSwap contracts.

So in summary, while the write-up provides some hints at potential vulnerabilities, there is not enough specific technical information provided to conclusively determine the exact weakness or vulnerabilities the attacker exploited. To make that determination, we would need to see more technical details like contract code snippets, details on the reentrance attack flow, specifics on removed validation checks, etc. So unfortunately I cannot provide a more definitive assessment without additional details on the attack vector. Please let me know if any further attack specifics can be provided.
