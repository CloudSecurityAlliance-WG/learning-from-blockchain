Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it appears the attacker exploited the fact that the withdrawal fee had been turned off in the Yearn DAI v1 vault during a migration. This allowed the attacker to repeatedly:

1. Take flash loans of ETH
2. Use the ETH as collateral to borrow large amounts of stablecoins from Compound
3. Deposit some stablecoins into the Curve 3pool to mint 3CRV tokens 
4. Withdraw other stablecoins from the Yearn yDAI vault for free due to the disabled withdrawal fee
5. Deposit the withdrawn stablecoins back into the Curve 3pool to mint more 3CRV
6. Repeat this arbitrage to accumulate more 3CRV tokens
7. Repay the flash loans
8. Swap the 3CRV for profit

So in summary, the lack of withdrawal fees during the migration allowed the attacker to efficiently extract value from the yDAI vault. The steps for how the attack was executed are clearly laid out. There is enough detail provided to determine how the attack took place.
