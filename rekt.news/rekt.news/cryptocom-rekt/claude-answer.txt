Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, there are no clear details about exactly how the attacker was able to bypass 2FA and email withdrawal approvals to drain user wallets. 

The write-up states that:

- Hundreds of Crypto.com users had their wallets drained of at least 4.6K ETH (worth about $15M)
- The funds were sent to Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency tumbler/mixer
- The attacker somehow bypassed existing 2FA and withdrawal whitelists that should have prevented unauthorized withdrawals

However, there is no technical explanation of the specific vulnerability or attack vector used. The article leaves it as an open question:

"How did the attacker bypass users 2FA, and their email withdrawal approvals?"

And later:

"The hacker bypassed existing 2FA, they bypassed the withdrawal whitelist, could this attack really have come from outside?"

So in summary, while it's clear that a serious exploit allowed the bypassing of security mechanisms and theft of user funds, the write-up does not contain enough specific technical details to determine exactly how the attack took place. There is speculation about the security mechanisms that were compromised, but no clear explanation of the methods used or vulnerabilities exploited.
