<strong>It’s worse than we thought.</strong></p><p>After our initial investigation, <a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1483540849434763264?s=20">ErgoBTC</a> uncovered even more lost funds from Crypto.com.</p><p><strong>Another 444 BTC: ~$18.7M.</strong></p><p>That brings the total value lost up to $33.7M, and moves Crypto.com up to position 15 on the leaderboard.</p><p><em>And still no acknowledgement of any loss from Crypto.com.</em></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1482936866001207296?s=20">“All funds safe”</a> ???</p></blockquote><p><strong>They’re lying to you.</strong></p><p><em><a href="https://twitter.com/ErgoBTC/status/1483540849434763264?s=20">ErgoBTC investigates…</a></em></p><blockquote><p>We noted this abnormally large withdrawal from @cryptocom's payout wallet <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1q7cyrfmck2ffu2ud3rn5l5a8yv6f0chkp0zpemf">bc1q7cyrfmck2ffu2ud3rn5l5a8yv6f0chkp0zpemf</a> via</p></blockquote><p><a href="https://t.co/D9yITrsei4">06f7b6adac715ea7f30e2f23f52b3dfeed53...</a></p><blockquote><p>Shortly after, several hundred withdrawals are consolidated into 4 outputs for 67.75 BTC.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The 271 BTC then make a series 24 or 25 BTC deposits to a well known BTC tumbler. 173 BTC at address <a href="https://www.blockchain.com/btc/address/bc1qk8wlwypvvr6v5lmsngg5a248k2a9cgrsrw5jsq">bc1qk8wlwypvvr6v5lmsngg5a248k2a9cgrsrw5jsq</a> is likely associated with the hack, has not yet been sent to the tumbler.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This tumbler has been commonly used in hacks attributed to the DPRK Lazarus Group and more recently in the attempted laundering of BTC from to this summer's Darkside ransomware activity.</p></blockquote><p><strong>These findings double the damage from our initial investigation, and increase the pressure on Crypto.com to come clean about what happened.</strong></p><p><em>At least the <a href="https://twitter.com/Kris_HK/status/1483277458262859776">CEO is happy…</a></em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/01/cryptocom-ceo.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>Crypto.com should stop <a href="https://twitter.com/LoadedLions_CDC/status/1483424355715809281?s=20">shitposting</a> and tell their users where their money has gone.</strong></p><p><em>Our original article continues below.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-text-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/01/cryptocom-header.png"/></figure>
<strong>Another CEX rekt, but they have yet to admit it.</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1482936866001207296?s=20">The first message</a> from crypto.com about the attack was at Jan-17-2022 04:44 AM UTC, stating that:</p><blockquote><p>”We have a small number of users reporting suspicious activity on their accounts.
We will be pausing withdrawals shortly, as our team is investigating. <strong>All funds are safe.</strong>”</p></blockquote><p><strong>~8 hours later, at 12:17,  Crypto.com doubled down on their statements, with <a href="https://twitter.com/cryptocom/status/1483050866894868484?s=20">a tweet</a> that said:</strong></p><blockquote><p>”Earlier today a small number of users experienced unauthorized activity in their accounts. <strong>All funds are safe.</strong>”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Later that day, at 18:44 +UTC, hundreds of users crypto.com wallets were drained.
