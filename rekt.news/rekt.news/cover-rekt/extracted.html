<strong>Next time, take care of your own shit.</strong></p><p>Infinite mint but it’s no Willy Wonka - this is a Hollywood classic insurance themed noir.</p><p>The black and white outcomes of insurance policies lend themselves well to Hollywood storylines.</p><p><strong>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKrrAa2o9Eg">Double Indemnity</a> (1944), insurance is the motivating force for both good and evil.</strong></p><p>The film takes its name from a life insurance clause that offers double payouts if the death of the policyholder is accidental.</p><p>This results in a twisting plot as an insurance salesman is roped into a murderous scheme by his lover, who wants him to murder her husband and frame it as an accident in order to profit from the payout.</p><p><strong>Never take anything at face value.</strong> DeFi plot lines are rarely straightforward. Anonymity and composability are the perfect breeding ground for conspiracy; there are multiple ways one can profit from a single incident, meaning smart players don’t always take the most obvious reward.</p><p><strong>$9.4m taken, $3.2m recovered and $6.2m lost.</strong></p><p><strong>COVER (formerly known as SAFE) fell ~<a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cover-protocol">90%</a> when an infinite mint loophole was uncovered and exploited,</strong> causing the total supply of tokens to increase by 48 quadrillion percent, from 84,477 to 40,796,131,214,802,600,000.</p><p>Six different addresses minted COVER via this loophole before it was closed. <strong>Some kept the money, others did not.</strong></p><p>Of the six addresses to use the loophole, the previously <a href="https://medium.com/@grap.finance">unknown</a><a href="https://etherscan.io/token/0xC8D2AB2a6FdEbC25432E54941cb85b55b9f152dB">Grap Finance</a> gained the most attention, as they took the opportunity to present themselves as a “White hat” by selling minted COVER for ETH and returning it with a sassy message.</p><p><strong>Code is law, but loopholes remain</strong> - we can rely on attackers to take advantage, but we know things are rarely as simple as they seem.</p><p>Who had cover on their $COVER? We went undercover to find out.
