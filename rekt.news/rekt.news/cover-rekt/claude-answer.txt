Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was an infinite mint loophole in the Cover Protocol's smart contracts. Specifically:

- A new Balancer pool was added to the Cover Protocol's "Blacksmith" contract, likely introducing the vulnerability.

- An attacker deposited some tokens into this contract.

- The attacker then called the "withdraw()" function, exploiting the contract to mint a large number of COVER tokens, worth about $703 at the time. 

- The attacker sold the exploited COVER tokens on the market. 

- The attacker continued minting more COVER tokens while the vulnerability was still present, stealing around $4.4 million in total.

So in summary, the attack exploited an infinite mint vulnerability introduced in a new Balancer pool integration. By depositing tokens and calling withdraw(), the attacker could mint arbitrary amounts of COVER tokens.

The post-mortem indicates this was possible due to an issue with storage/memory in the contract. But there are no further technical details provided on the specific vulnerability. So while the high-level attack is clear, the underlying coding flaw that enabled it is not described.
