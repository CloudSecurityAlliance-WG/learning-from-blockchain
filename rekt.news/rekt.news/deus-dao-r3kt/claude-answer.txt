Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a misconfiguration in the Deus DAO DEI token contract's `burnFrom` function. Specifically:

- The `burnFrom` function had its `msgSender` and `account` parameters written in the wrong order. 
- This allowed the attacker to:
    - Set a large token approval for any DEI holder's address
    - Call `burnFrom` with amount = 0 and the DEI holder's address
    - This granted approval for all of that holder's tokens to the attacker's address 
    - The attacker could then drain the funds using `transferFrom`

So in summary, the vulnerability was the incorrect parameter order in the `burnFrom` function, which allowed the attacker to manipulate token approvals and transfer user funds to themselves. This seems like a simple yet devastating implementation bug.
