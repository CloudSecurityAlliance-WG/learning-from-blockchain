However, just 10 days after launch, the new mechanism was attacked, depegging USP and leaving it heavily undercollateralised.</p><p>The Platypus team <a href="https://twitter.com/Platypusdefi/status/1626396538611310592">announced</a> the attack:</p><blockquote><p>Dear Community,</p><p>We regret to inform you that our protocol was hacked recently, and the attacker took advantage of a flaw in our USP solvency check mechanism. They used a flashloan to exploit a logic error in the USP solvency check mechanism in the contract holding the collateral.</p></blockquote><p>According to a recent <a href="https://medium.com/platypus-finance/platypus-recap-the-2022-2023-transition-503ca5483076">announcement</a> on the launch, USP “<em>provides an extra layer of protection from the volatility that other stablecoins may experience</em>”.</p><p><em>A statement worthy of a Darwin award?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p>Credit: <em><a href="https://twitter.com/danielvf/status/1626340324103663617">Daniel Von Fange</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1626367531480125440">Peckshield</a></em></p><p><strong>The exploit took advantage of a faulty check mechanism when withdrawing collateral.</strong></p><p>The attacker first took a flash loan of 44M USDC which was deposited into Platypus. The resulting LP tokens were then used as collateral to borrow 41.7M USP.</p><p>The <em>emergencyWithdraw()</em> function only checks whether the user’s position is <em>currently</em> solvent, but neglects to first check against any the effect of any borrowed funds. This allows the attacker to withdraw the supplied collateral while keeping the borrowed USP.</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2023/01/platypus-code.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>The collateral was then withdrawn to repay the flash loan, and the USP was swapped via Platypus pools, draining the existing liquidity of other stables (USDC, USDT, DAI, BUSD, etc.).</strong></p><p><strong>Attacker’s address: <a href="https://snowtrace.io/address/0xeff003d64046a6f521ba31f39405cb720e953958">0xeff003d64046a6f521ba31f39405cb720e953958</a></strong></p><p><strong>Attack tx: <a href="https://snowtrace.io/tx/0x1266a937c2ccd970e5d7929021eed3ec593a95c68a99b4920c2efa226679b430">0x1266a937…</a></strong></p><p><strong>Attack contract: <a href="https://snowtrace.io/address/0x67afdd6489d40a01dae65f709367e1b1d18a5322/">0x67afdd6489d40a01dae65f709367e1b1d18a5322/</a></strong></p><p><strong>The hack has left <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/platypus-usd">USP</a> depegged by over 50% as the attacker swapped the USP for other stables. The stolen $8.5M remain in the hacker’s <a href="https://snowtrace.io/address/0x67afdd6489d40a01dae65f709367e1b1d18a5322/">contract</a>, of which, $1.5M of stolen USDT <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1626335278972510208">has been blacklisted</a>.</strong></p><p>The rather simple vulnerability, combined with the loot being left (<em>or possibly <a href="https://twitter.com/BlockSecTeam/status/1626429271614038016">trapped</a></em>) as freezable, centralised stables suggests this heist may have been pulled off by a relatively inexperienced amateur.</p><p><em>Why not swap to a less controlled asset? Or bridge the funds and send them to Tornado?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>As it turns out, OPSEC is not this hacker’s strong suit.</strong></p><p>After just a few hours, fellow platypus <a href="https://twitter.com/zachxbt/status/1626434265260118021">ZachXBT managed to identify the culprit</a> via their ENS address, linked to the exploiter’s transaction history. The same alias was used for now-deleted Twitter and Instagram accounts. The Platypus team have since <a href="https://twitter.com/Platypusdefi/status/1626503606953451520">appealed</a> to the doxxed exploiter:</p><blockquote><p>We're in the process of setting up a bounty &amp; encourage the hacker to reach out to us. We also welcome anyone with useful information to come forward to us.</p></blockquote><p><em>Safety in numbers…</em></p><p><strong>Just like the Platypus itself, DeFi is a strange and unique beast.</strong></p><p><em>A hybrid species born of cypherpunk hackers and finance bros, every protocol must speedrun their way through natural selection.</em></p><p>It’s a <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">jungle</a> out there…</p><p><em>…and, as ever, it’s survival of the fittest.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
