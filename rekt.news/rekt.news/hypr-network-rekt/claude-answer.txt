Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack. 

The key details that are missing are:

1. Technical specifics on the vulnerability itself - the writeup mentions it had to do with circumventing a check in the 'finalizeERC20Withdrawal' function due to the 'clearLegacySlot' modifier, but does not provide code snippets or further details.

2. Exact steps for how the attacker exploited this vulnerability - while the transactions related to the hack are linked, there are no specifics on how the attacker managed to bypass the withdrawal check using the contract vulnerability.

3. Version details - the writeup mentions that Hypr used an outdated develop branch that contained a vulnerability that was later patched, but does not specify the affected contract versions.

Without code examples, specifics on how the vulnerability was exploited, and version details, there is not enough technical information provided in the writeup to determine the root cause and exact attack vector used. 

The key takeaway seems to be that Hypr deployed contracts containing a critical vulnerability that was present in an outdated codebase they forked from Optimism, and they failed to update their contracts even after a patch was released. This highlights the need for better communication and updating practices when building on forked code. But the writeup lacks the technical specifics to analyze the vulnerability itself.
