Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this attack was a known "read-only reentrancy vulnerability" in the WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token that Midas Capital recently added as a collateral type. 

Specifically:

- The WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token has a vulnerability where the virtual price of the token can be manipulated if improperly implemented
- Midas Capital did not properly account for this vulnerability when adding the WMATIC-stMATIC token as a collateral type
- The attacker was able to exploit this by:
  1. Manipulating the virtual price of the WMATIC-stMATIC token held as collateral
  2. Tricking Midas into overestimating the value of the collateral
  3. Borrowing excess assets against this inflated collateral
- The attacker then swapped the borrowed assets into MATIC and withdrew them

The key technical elements enabling this attack were:

- Improper implementation of the WMATIC-stMATIC token contract in Midas, leaving it vulnerable to manipulation
- The ability for the attacker to manipulate the virtual price of the collateral token
- Overestimation of collateral value based on the manipulated price
- No checks or reconciliations to prevent over-borrowing against this inflated collateral

In summary, the root cause was a known vulnerability in a newly added collateral type that was not properly accounted for. The attacker exploited this to artificially increase borrowing power and drain funds.
