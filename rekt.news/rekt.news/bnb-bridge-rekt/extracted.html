Amidst the confusion, the Venus team were keen to <a href="https://twitter.com/VenusProtocol/status/1578166457435033600">point out</a> that their protocol hadn’t suffered an exploit, although their users faced a spike in rates as borrow liquidity was withdrawn.</p><p>The tactic of borrowing rather than dumping initially led some to believe that this may just be a gigawhale <a href="https://twitter.com/jeffthedunker/status/1578121391223713792">moving funds</a> around. However, as users began to notice <a href="https://bscscan.com/tx/0x0cc52b19aac4c2032358fb757d0800177e5a0d27f7ca5398b58fc7fd24f48037">high-slippage swaps</a> and Tether <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0xaafa4200c567b429a9ac2353162d551188d2bf01221ebbbcfe09e170dfdd8dc8">blacklisting funds</a>, it became clear that this was something more sinister.</p><p><strong>Likely anticipating that Binance would halt the chain, the exploiter raced to find liquidity to bridge and move as much of the loot as possible to other chains.</strong></p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1578220472373649408">SlowMist</a> traced the movement of funds. First, the attacker supplied 900k BNB to Venus, borrowing a total of $147M in stablecoins, before bridging to Ethereum and L2s, Fantom (now making up over <a href="https://defillama.com/chain/Fantom">10% of TVL</a>), Avalanche and Polygon networks.</p><p>See <a href="https://twitter.com/SlowMist_Team/status/1578220472373649408">SlowMist’s table</a> below for a breakdown of the <a href="https://debank.com/profile/0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec">exploiter’s positions</a>, including frozen USDT (totalling ~$6.5M).</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/10/binance-table.png"/></figure></p><p>When the BNB team halted the chain, approximately 90 mins after the second transaction, the hacker lost access to the ~$430M still on their <a href="https://bscscan.com/address/0x489a8756c18c0b8b24ec2a2b9ff3d4d447f79bec">BSC address</a>.

But with just “26 active validators”, does BNB chain qualify as decentralised in the first place?</p><p><em>And was it ever, really, credibly decentralised?</em></p><p>The update also sets out some next steps, including governance votes to decide on whether to freeze or burn the stolen funds, and establishing Bug Bounty and whitehat bounty programmes.</p><p>The number of “<em>community validators</em>” will also be increased in a “<em>move toward further decentralisation</em>” (or reduced responsibility).</p><p><strong>Covering the funds that found their way off-chain is a drop in the ocean for Binance.</strong></p><p>And as CZ <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1578174707035013120">makes clear</a>, his size <em>is</em> size: “The current impact estimate is around $100m USD equvilent, about a quarter of the last BNB burn.”</p><p>However, the Binance CEO has also distanced himself from the incident, <a href="https://twitter.com/cz_binance/status/1578305040112316418">tweeting</a> that he is “<em>not that involved in the technical side of BNB Chain. Far less than Vitalik with ETH.</em>” possibly attempting to convince any regulators looking for a DeFi scapegoat that their attentions should be directed elsewhere…</p><p>If the chain could have been paused this time, why not for all the other BSC hacks we’ve covered? And how will this look in the eyes of regulators, now that it’s clear they’ve been in control the entire time…</p><p><strong>More importantly, though, a dangerous precedent has been set by pressing pause on such a heavily-used network.</strong> If we ever reach mass-adoption of crypto for day-to-day transactions, how could these acts be justified when chain halts could, ultimately, mean the difference between life and death?</p><p>But, as <a href="https://twitter.com/CoinSpice/status/1125979761728049152">this video</a> from 2019 shows, CZ doesn’t regard the immutability of blockchains as sacrosanct. Although the plan never went ahead, he contemplates the rolling back of the Bitcoin network despite the “far reaching consequences” and risk of “destroying credibility”.</p><p><strong>Will BNB’s involvement in “DeFi” retain any credibility after today?</strong></p><p><em>For now, though, it’s just another bridge exploit, and one more entry on the <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">leaderboard</a>.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
