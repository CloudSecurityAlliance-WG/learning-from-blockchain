Growth DeFi? Small name backstreet protocols are easy prey for the serial killers who roam these streets without fear.</p><p><strong>We’ve been through this before, you know the deal. Manipulate the price, call earn, and withdraw the loot. Nothing new under the sun, why change the plan if it always works?</strong></p><p>BT Finance would have been stopped by a copyright claim if the hackers hadn’t got to them first, so they were already set to fail. For the few users who were tempted in by their sultry slogan of “Best yield for tokens”, maybe they should have seen this coming…</p><p>If you’re depositing your money into a protocol that is trying something new, or competing with what’s currently on offer, then taking on a certain level of risk can be justified. However, these low quality copycat bits of code are by and for simple gamblers who don’t look long term.</p><p><strong>So <a href="https://twitter.com/emilianobonassi/status/1358884929313140736?s=20">BT Finance done</a>, no surprise.</strong></p><p><a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x82f95242963ac274d63e78234cb71c156f3135c32037e7e5b4424a6043da2a9a">$1.5 million</a>.
