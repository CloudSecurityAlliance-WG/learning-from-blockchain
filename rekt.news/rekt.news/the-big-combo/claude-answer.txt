Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there are not enough details provided in the text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attackers used to execute their attacks. 

The text mentions some high-level aspects of the attacks:

For BT Finance:
- The attackers were able to "manipulate the price, call earn, and withdraw the loot" to steal $1.5 million

For Growth DeFi: 
- The attacker forced the staking contract to accept a fake token, then removed $1.3 million in liquidity
- The attacker created a fake token, supplied liquidity with it, staked that liquidity, and then removed legitimate liquidity

However, there are no technical details provided on the specific vulnerabilities exploited that allowed the attackers to manipulate prices, force acceptance of fake tokens, etc.

Without more technical information on the affected contracts and transactions, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability or weakness the attackers leveraged. As the prompt suggested, the best response is:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."

Please let me know if any additional details can be provided that might shed more light on the specific attack vectors used.
