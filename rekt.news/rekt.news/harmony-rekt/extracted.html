note.</strong></p><p><em>To the tune of $100M.</em></p><p>This is the 3rd bridge in the <a href="https://rekt.news/leaderboard/">top 10</a>, and the second drained via compromised private keys.</p><p>Over 14 hours after the first funds began to move, the theft was <a href="https://twitter.com/harmonyprotocol/status/1540110924400324608">announced</a>.</p><p><strong>Were nine figures really secured by just <em>two</em> signatures?</strong></p><p><figure><img alt=""

addresses remains unknown, though some have <a href="https://twitter.com/Mudit__Gupta/status/1540225237912010753">speculated</a> that they were hot wallets with private keys kept in plaintext.</p><p>If an attacker managed to gain access to the servers running these hot wallets, they would have access to the two addresses necessary to pass any transactions they like, such as draining $100M from the bridge.</p><p><strong>Exploiter address:</strong> <a

incident, in which keys to 5 of 9 validators were compromised, there has been much talk of the sophisticated <a href="https://rekt.news/big-phish/">spearphishing campaigns</a> ascribed to the Lazarus group.</strong></p><p>With threats like these known to be <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/blog/snatchcrypto-bluenoroff/43412/">relentlessly targeting</a> cryptocurrency projects, the fact that another entire network’s official bridge could be drained by compromising just two addresses is far from acceptable.</p><p><strong>Not only should the other cases have set the alarm bells ringing, but in early April <a href="https://twitter.com/_apedev/status/1510007663832223751">@_apedev</a> specifically called out the Harmony bridge’s precarious security situation.</strong></p><p>How did the devs overlook, and then ignore, such lax security for securing 9 figures of users’ funds?</p><p>Harmony always struggled with attracting users.</p><p>After this attack, and with market sentiment at all time lows, is this the final encore for Harmony Network?</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
