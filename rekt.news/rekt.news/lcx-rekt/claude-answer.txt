Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack on LCX. 

The key details that are missing are:

1) How the attacker gained access to LCX's private keys in the first place. This is the critical first step that enabled the theft. Some possibilities include:

- A vulnerability in LCX's wallet or infrastructure that allowed key extraction
- Phishing attack on an LCX employee to steal keys 
- Insider compromise at LCX

Without knowing how the keys were compromised, it's impossible to fully analyze the attack vector.

2) Technical details on how the funds were moved out of LCX's wallet. The report states that the funds were moved to the hacker's wallet and Tornado Cash, but does not provide the specific transactions or any other technical information.

So in summary, while the overall impact of the attack is clear ($7.94M stolen), the underlying methodology is not described in a level of detail that would allow a definitive assessment of the specific vulnerability. The key phrase that sums this up is:

"There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."

Additional data around the initial access point and the transactions used to drain the funds would be needed to provide a more complete analysis. Please let me know if any other details from the report could aid in further assessing this incident.
