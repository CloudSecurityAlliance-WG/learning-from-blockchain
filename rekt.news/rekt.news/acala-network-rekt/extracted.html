Other users profited from the same malfunction, amounting to approximately $1.6M in stolen funds. However, while still not back at peg, the price of aUSD has remained above $0.90 since the protocol was reactivated.</p><hr/><p>The one billion that wasn’t.</p><p>Tornado sanctions didn’t deter these Polkadot thieves, who tried to steal ~$1.3B in <a href="https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/acala-dollar">aUSD</a> from <a href="https://acala.network/ausd">Acala Network</a>: the self-proclaimed “DeFi Hub of Polkadot”.</p><p>However, Polkadot plays differently to Ethereum, and the transfers were quickly disabled <em>“until a pending Acala community governance decision resolves the error”.</em></p><p>Meanwhile, the aUSD price chart shows an all too familiar pattern…</p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2022/08/alcala-price.png"/></figure></p><p>Acala has yet to confirm the exact amount that was permanently stolen, as even with the disabled transfers, some funds still slipped through the net.</p><p><strong>Now we wait and we wonder, how much can Acala return or replace?</strong></p><p><em>And where should this go on the leaderboard?</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/09/rekt-investigates-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>Acala stated that:</strong></p><blockquote><p>"We have identified the issue as a misconfiguration of the iBTC/aUSD liquidity pool (which went live earlier today) that resulted in error mints of a significant amount of aUSD,"</p></blockquote><p><em>and…</em></p><blockquote><p>"The misconfiguration has since been rectified and wallet addresses that received the errorneously minted aUSD have been identified, with on-chain activity tracing in respect of these addresses underway."</p></blockquote><p>Let’s take a look at this “misconfiguration”.</p><p>Credit: <a href="https://twitter.com/alice_und_bob">@alice_und_bob</a></p><p>The misconfigured iBTC - aUSD pool had recently concluded bootstrapping and begun to trade. It was incentivized with aUSD, ACA &amp; INTR.</p><p>However, the <em>incentives.claim_rewards()</em> extrinsic in Acala wrongfully minted <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24aUSD&amp;src=cashtag_click">$aUSD</a> in exponential amounts (1.3B in total).</p><p>While most of the attention has gone toward the one user who minted 1.2b aUSD <em>(greedy)</em>, at the same time a handful of other users exploited the situation by:</p><p>a) sending $aUSD to Moonbeam.</p><p>b) swapping for $DOT and sending it to Polkadot.</p><p>c) swapping for $iBTC and sending it to Interlay.</p><p>The $iBTC/pool was almost completely drained, but the DOT pool managed to retain some of the value, because it was a DOT - LCDOT pool and users had to go through this route, which mitigated the damage.</p><p>The two wallets that profited the most are listed below.</p><p>23bmUgSeKMD8Y9triphPw5YHuiz3QUJNqcbmb3Eg9QMQDMWN</p><p>253pFTg22JqHbLeLZupexGMDUuXAJLfEriTYkFqvGWPuwcFi</p><p>A few other users extracted value from the misconfiguration, but it is harder to tell if they did so with bad intent.</p><p>In total, $1.6M in “good value” was transferred off-chain, and $4.6M of “bad debt” in the form of wrongly minted $aUSD also left the chain.</p><p><strong>As Acala and Polkadot were able to so easily disable the stolen funds, we’re not left with not much to say.</strong></p><p>Like the stories of “compromised keys”, we simply wait and see what those in control decide to do.</p><p>Will wrongly minted <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24aUSD&amp;src=cashtag_click">$aUSD</a> be destroyed?</p><p>Will they have to roll back the chain?</p><p><strong>And where should this story go on the leaderboard?!</strong></p><p>We’ll let our <a href="https://t.me/Rekt_HQ">Telegram group</a> members decide.</p><p><em>Probably.</em></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
