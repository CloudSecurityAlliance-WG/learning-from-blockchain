Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the Akropolis protocol to steal $2 million in DAI tokens. Specifically:

1. The attacker created a malicious ERC-20 token contract. 

2. They deposited this malicious token into the Akropolis protocol. 

3. The deposit triggered a callback to the malicious token contract. 

4. The callback reentered the Akropolis deposit function to make another deposit of 25k DAI tokens, supplied via a flash loan. 

5. Because of the reentrant call, the Akropolis protocol incorrectly calculated the deposit amount and credited the attacker for 50k DAI instead of 25k.

6. The attacker withdrew the extra 25k DAI.

This attack relied on reentrancy - the ability of a contract to call back into the calling contract before the first invocation completes. This allowed the attacker to manipulate the deposit amount calculation. The flash loan provided the capital needed to deposit and exploit the vulnerability.

The key pieces of information that allowed me to determine this are:

- Mention of "re-entrancy" 
- The deposit amount being calculated as the difference before and after
- The attack contract making an additional deposit via callback
- Withdrawing double the actual deposit amount

So in summary, this was a reentrancy attack using a malicious token contract and flash loan. The details provided are sufficient to determine how it was executed.
