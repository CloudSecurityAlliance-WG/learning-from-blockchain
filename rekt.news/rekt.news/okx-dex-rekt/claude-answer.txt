Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a compromised private key:

Specifically, the private key for the Proxy Admin account was compromised. The Proxy Admin controls the DEX Proxy contract, which is trusted by the main DEX contract to invoke transfers of user funds. 

By compromising the Proxy Admin private key, the attacker was able to upgrade the DEX Proxy contract to a malicious implementation that allowed them to directly drain funds from the DEX contract. 

The key steps of the attack were:

1. Attacker compromised the private key for the Proxy Admin account
2. Attacker used the Proxy Admin account to upgrade the DEX Proxy contract
3. The malicious DEX Proxy contract was then able to invoke transfers out of the main DEX contract

So in summary, the root cause was a private key compromise of a trusted account (the Proxy Admin). This allowed the attacker to exploit the trust relationship between the Proxy Admin, DEX Proxy contract, and main DEX contract to steal user funds.
