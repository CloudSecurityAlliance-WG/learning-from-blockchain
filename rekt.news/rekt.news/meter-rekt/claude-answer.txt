Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability exploited by the attacker was related to an assumption made in the Meter.io Passport bridge contract regarding wrapped native tokens. 

Specifically, the contract assumed that if the bridged token was a wrapped native token like wETH, it did not need to burn or lock the tokens since they were already unwrapped. However, this assumption only held true for one of the deposit methods in the contract (depositEth) which validated the deposit amount, but not for another deposit method that was unguarded. 

The attacker noticed this discrepancy and was able to call the unguarded deposit method with an arbitrary (likely very large) amount in the calldata. This amount then got passed to the token handler's deposit method and allowed the attacker to mint a substantial number of tokens and drain reserves.

In summary, the attack took advantage of:

- An incorrect assumption regarding wrapped native tokens in the bridge contract
- An unguarded deposit method that did not validate the deposit amount
- The ability to pass an arbitrary amount to the token handler's deposit method via the unguarded method

This allowed the attacker to mint tokens and drain reserves. The technical details provided seem sufficient to determine how the attack was carried out.
