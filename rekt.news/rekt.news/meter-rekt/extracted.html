Going forward we will be stricter on this, and publish more detailed information about which bridges are used for which assets. We will also look into extra monitoring for possible attacks like this.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Meter have of course accepted responsibility for this hack and are intending to use their native token for reimbursement to the extent that they can, currently we are in the gathering addresses and amounts stage.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>One interesting thing is that there were 4 opportunistic loans at Hundred in total, but the first 2 have been repaid, so there is some modicum of hope still for the other 2.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Current loss to Hundred users is $3.3M.</p></blockquote><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/03/rekt-linebreak.png"/></figure></p><p><strong>The voluntary repayments of the “opportunistic loans” taken on Hundred Finance are a rare sight to see, and it is commendable that Meter are accepting full responsibility for all losses.</strong></p><p>Meter <a href="https://twitter.com/Meter_IO/status/1490103313521524738">claim to have some evidence</a> as to the identity of the hacker, and have stated they are working with authorities to bring justice.</p><p><strong>However, on-chain crime rarely has off-chain consequences, and it won’t be long until we see another attack of this type.</strong></p><p><strong>There will be more bridge attacks, and more users will lose money, but eventually someone will succeed in building a safe bridge.</strong></p><p><em>We are still too early to be risk-free, but that just means more opportunity.</em></p>
