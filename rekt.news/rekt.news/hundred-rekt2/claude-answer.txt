Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the exchange rate calculation between the hWBTC token and WBTC in the Hundred Finance protocol. Specifically:

1. There were two hWBTC tokens, one used by the UI and one that was empty. 

2. The attacker obtained a flash loan of 500 WBTC from Aave.

3. The attacker then donated the 500 WBTC to the empty hWBTC contract. This inflated the exchange rate between hWBTC and WBTC. 

4. Due to a rounding error in the `redeemUnderlying` function, the attacker was able to redeem their small amount of hWBTC (about 2 wei worth) for a very large amount of WBTC based on the manipulated exchange rate.

5. The attacker then deposited the WBTC back into the hWBTC contract and borrowed a large amount of ETH.

6. The ETH was withdrawn for profit.

In summary, the attack exploited:

- The existence of two hWBTC tokens, one of which could be manipulated
- The ability to donate WBTC to manipulate exchange rates 
- A rounding error in `redeemUnderlying`

By manipulating exchange rates, the attacker was able to redeem a tiny amount of hWBTC for a disproportionately large amount of assets.
