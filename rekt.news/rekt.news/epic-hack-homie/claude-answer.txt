Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack. 

The key details that are missing are:

1. How the attacker gained access to the private keys for Kucoin's hot wallets. The write-up states this was done through "access to the hot wallet private key rather than a brute force attack", but does not explain how this access was obtained. 

2. Whether there was a vulnerability on Kucoin's end (e.g. a flaw in their key management system, access controls, infrastructure configuration) that enabled the unauthorized access, or if it was through social engineering, insider threat, or some other vector.

Without knowing how the attacker gained the initial unauthorized access, it is impossible to point to the specific vulnerability, weakness or attack vector. 

The write-up does say that "relatively unadvanced techniques" were used to launder the funds after the unauthorized access occurred. This suggests that the initial access/key compromise itself may have been the critical flaw, rather than an advanced crypto-specific attack. But there are still too few technical specifics provided to determine exactly how it happened based on the information given.

In summary, while a lot of helpful background is provided on the incident response and aftermath, there is not enough detail revealed here regarding the initial intrusion to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness exploited. Please let me know if any clarifying details can be provided.
