Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker compromised Badger DAO's front-end to insert additional token approvals that allowed the attacker to later drain user funds. Specifically:

- The attacker was able to manipulate Badger's front-end to show unusual token approvals when users attempted legitimate transactions like deposits and reward claims. 

- These approvals allowed the attacker to increase their allowance to spend user tokens. Over 500 user addresses approved the attacker's address, granting them unlimited access to funds.

- Armed with these approvals, the attacker was then able to drain user funds, stealing $120 million in various coins. They transferred tokens directly from user wallets.

- An example transaction shows the attacker draining ~900 byvWBTC (worth over $50M) from a user that had approved the attacker's address to spend unlimited tokens just hours earlier.

So in summary, the attacker focused on compromising Badger's front-end to trick users into unknowingly granting broad token approvals, which enabled the theft. The front-end manipulation went undetected for at least 12 days. This highlights the need for projects to aggressively monitor for unauthorized changes to critical infrastructure like front-end code.
