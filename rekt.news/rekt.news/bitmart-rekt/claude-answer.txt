Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, it is unclear exactly how the attacker gained access to BitMart's hot wallets. The write-up states:

"It remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question. Hopefully it wasn’t another basic OPSEC error such as granting unlimited approvals to an EOA, as in Celsius’ case."

So the vulnerability or weakness used is currently unknown. There is speculation it could have been due to an "OPSEC error" like granting excessive permissions, but no confirmed details.

The key phrase indicating there is not enough information is:

"It remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question."

So in summary:

There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place. More details are needed on the specific vulnerability exploited by the attacker to access BitMart's hot wallets. The write-up makes it clear the method is currently unknown pending further investigation.
