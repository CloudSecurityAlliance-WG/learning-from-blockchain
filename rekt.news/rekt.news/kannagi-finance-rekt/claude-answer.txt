Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the main vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute the rug pull was the ability for the MainChef contract to initiate withdrawals on behalf of users. Specifically, this quote indicates the issue:

"The MainChef address can initiate a withdrawal on behalf of a user by specifying the user's address and an amount to withdraw."

This allowed the attacker, who likely controlled the MainChef contract, to forcibly withdraw funds from user accounts without their consent. 

The audit report called out this centralized capability, but it seems users and endorsers of the protocol overlooked or downplayed this weakness. Ultimately, the attacker was able to exploit this withdrawal functionality to drain funds from the protocol into their own wallet.

The information provides reasonably clear technical details on how the attack was carried out, so there is enough evidence to determine the vulnerability. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!
