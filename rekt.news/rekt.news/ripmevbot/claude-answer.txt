Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack against the MEV bot 0xbad. 

The text mentions that 0xbad's arbitrage contract code had a flaw that allowed the attacker to get 0xbad to approve all of their WETH to the attacker's contract. But the details of what this flaw was are not provided.

Bertcmiller of Flashbots is quoted as saying: "0xbad did not properly protect the function that they used to execute the dYdX flashloans." But no further technical details about this unprotected function or how the attacker was able to exploit it are given.

So in summary, while the text indicates there was a vulnerability in 0xbad's contract code that allowed the attacker to steal its funds, there is not enough technical information provided to determine the specifics of how the attack took place. The key phrase that sums this up is: "There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."
