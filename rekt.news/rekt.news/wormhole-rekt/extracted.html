However, in the recent January crash, users were <a href="https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1485315186797936646">unable</a> to top up their collateral and avoid liquidation, with <a href="https://twitter.com/solendprotocol/status/1485315192716083202">oracle issues</a> leading to further erroneous liquidations.</p><p>That being said, Solana is not yet the battle-hardened network that Ethereum has grown to be. Every exploit, for all the damage it does, offers a lesson for how to secure an evolving ecosystem. Newer L1s are thrown into the deep end, into a world of veteran exploiters where they will either sink or learn to swim.</p><p>Given the seriousness of this incident, along with the <a href="https://rekt.news/qubit-rekt/">Qubit exploit</a> last week and last summer’s mammoth attack on <a href="https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/">Poly Network</a>, Vitalik Buterin seems to have been proven right about his recent <a href="https://twitter.com/vitalikbuterin/status/1479501366192132099">security concerns</a> around cross-chain protocols.</p><p>In the race across the cryptoverse to reach experimental and more lucrative opportunities, many are willing to trust in newer tech. But when one of these gateways fails, the damage done can be immense.</p><p><strong>It remains to be seen whether the future of DeFi will be cross-chain or ‘multi-chain’, but either way, the journey there will be long and dangerous.</strong></p><p><figure><img alt="" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RektHQ/Assets/main/images/2021/08/rekt-outline-conc.png"/></figure></p>
