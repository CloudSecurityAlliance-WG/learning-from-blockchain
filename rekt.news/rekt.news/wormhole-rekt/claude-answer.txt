Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the write-up to conclusively determine the full technical details of how the Wormhole exploit was carried out. 

However, the write-up does provide some high-level details:

1. The attacker was able to bypass Wormhole's "guardians" that are designed to verify transfers between chains. This was done by reusing a SignatureSet from a previous transaction.

2. There was a discrepancy between the solana_program library Wormhole was using and the actual precompiled sysvar::instructions on Solana. This allowed the attacker to provide an address with 0.1 ETH instead of the full 120k ETH.

3. The attacker was then able to fake the SignatureSet, call the complete_wrapped function, and mint 120k wrapped ETH (wETH) on Solana that was not truly backed on Ethereum. 

4. 93,750 ETH worth of the fraudulently minted wETH was bridged back to Ethereum. The rest was liquidated into USDC and SOL on Solana.

So in summary, the core vulnerability seems to have involved a way to bypass/fake Wormhole's cross-chain verification mechanisms by reusing and manipulating existing transactions and signatures. But without more technical specifics on the transactions and contracts involved, it's difficult to explain the full attack flow. The write-up acknowledges that more details are still forthcoming in Wormhole's incident report.
