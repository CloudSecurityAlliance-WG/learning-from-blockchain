Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to steal the $34 million from Vee Finance. 

The text mentions that the attacker was able to manipulate asset prices that Vee Finance referenced from Pangolin pools by making trades between newly created pairs. This allowed transactions to bypass Vee Finance's slippage checks. However, the specifics of how the attacker was able to create these new trading pairs and manipulate prices are not explained. 

The text also notes that Vee Finance did not follow recommendations from audits by SlowMist and Certik, but does not specify what those recommendations were or how they could have prevented this attack.

Without more technical details about the exact attack flow and methods used to manipulate prices and approve fraudulent transactions, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability the attacker exploited. The text provides a high-level description of the incident but lacks the specific technical details needed to conclusively analyze the attack vector.

In summary, while the text describes the broad contours of the incident, there is simply not enough technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness exploited by the attacker. More details would be needed to fully analyze the attack flow and methods.
