Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, it seems the attack vector was a data breach that compromised Remitano's hot wallet private keys:

>"The post explains that upon notification of the breach, they consolidated assets from other hot wallets into secure cold storage addresses, and collaborated with Tether to freeze funds."

>"A total of 1.9M in USDT was frozen by Tether across the two chains, the remaining funds on Ethereum were swapped to ETH and deposited to an exchange"

This indicates the attackers gained access to the private keys for Remitano's hot wallets, likely through some kind of data breach that exposed the keys. The attackers were then able to sign transactions with the compromised keys to drain funds from the hot wallets.

The write-up does not provide enough technical details to determine exactly how the private keys were compromised or what the data breach entailed. But it's clear the root cause was a data breach that allowed the attackers to steal the private keys and gain control of Remitano's hot wallet funds.
