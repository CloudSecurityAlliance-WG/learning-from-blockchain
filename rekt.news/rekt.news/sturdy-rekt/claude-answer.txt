Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability allowing them to manipulate the price oracle used by Sturdy Finance. Specifically:

1. The attacker took out a flash loan to manipulate the reported price of the B-stETH-STABLE collateral token.

2. The SturdyOracle price oracle then returned this manipulated price to Sturdy Finance. 

3. With the manipulated price, the attacker was likely able to drain collateral from Sturdy Finance or take out undercollateralized loans. 

4. The attacker then immediately laundered the $800k in profits through Tornado Cash.

The key pieces enabling this attack were:

- Sturdy Finance's reliance on the SturdyOracle price oracle, which was vulnerable to manipulation
- The ability to manipulate the price of the B-stETH-STABLE collateral token using a flash loan 
- The unpatched reentrancy vulnerability that allowed the attacker to drain funds based on the manipulated price

In summary, the attacker exploited the vulnerable SturdyOracle oracle and a reentrancy bug to manipulate collateral prices and steal funds from Sturdy Finance.
