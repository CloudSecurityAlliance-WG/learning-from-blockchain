Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a lack of proper verification of the token_account_ids parameter in the redeem_skyward function. Specifically:

- The redeem_skyward function allows users to redeem their SKYWARD tokens for wNEAR from the treasury
- However, the function does not properly verify the token_account_ids parameter
- This allowed the attacker to pass their own withdrawal address repeatedly within the transaction to drain the treasury of wNEAR
- The attacker called the redeem_skyward function in a loop, draining 1.1M NEAR (worth $3.2M at the time) from the treasury

So in summary, the vulnerability was the lack of input validation on a critical function parameter that allowed the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds. There are enough technical details provided to determine how the attack took place.
