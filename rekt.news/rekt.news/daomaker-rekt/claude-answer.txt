Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the information provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in DAO Maker's init() function, which allowed them to reinitialize token contracts with malicious data. Specifically:

1. The init() function was left vulnerable, allowing the attacker to reinitialize 4 token contracts (0x6e70c88be1d5c2a4c0c8205764d01abe6a3d2e22, 0xd6c8dd834abeeefa7a663c1265ce840ca457b1ec, 0xdd571023d95ff6ce5716bf112ccb752e86212167, 0xa43b89d5e7951d410585360f6808133e8b919289) with malicious data.

2. After reinitializing the contracts, the attacker then used the emergencyExit() function to withdraw funds from each contract. 

3. The attacker went on to sell the stolen tokens on 1inch and MetaMask Swap Router for DAI.

So in summary, the vulnerability was in the init() function which allowed the attacker to reinitialize token contracts and set malicious data. The attacker then used the emergencyExit() function to steal funds. After stealing the funds, they sold the tokens on DEXes.
