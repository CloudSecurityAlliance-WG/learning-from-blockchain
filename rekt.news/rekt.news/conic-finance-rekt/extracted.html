Thus, the attacker can withdraw more than deposited.</p></blockquote><p>A more detailed breakdown can be found in Daniel Von Fange’s <a href="https://twitter.com/danielvf/status/1682496333540741121">thread</a>.</p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/peckshield/status/1682354822899712001">According</a> to auditors Peckshield, the vulnerability was identified in the <a href="https://conic.finance/media/PeckShield-Audit-Report-ConicFinance.pdf">audit</a>, however a new oracle contract reintroduced the bug.</strong></p><blockquote><p>FWIW, our audit identifies a similar read-only reentrancy issue. However, the same issue is introduced in the newly introduced CurveLPOracleV2 contract, which was not part of the audit scope.</p></blockquote><p>Conic dev <a href="https://twitter.com/0xWicket/status/1682379983010791424">0xWicket</a> later clarified that the contract did have inbuilt reentrancy protection, however it wasn’t triggered due to a mix-up between ETH and WETH addresses.</p><blockquote><p>We are currently in the process of writing a post-mortem. The root cause of this being exploitable was our assumption that ETH was treated as address 0xeee... by Curve, while it uses the the WETH address for V2 pools. Our reentrancy protection failed to trigger because of that</p></blockquote><p>Exploiter address (1st attack): <strong><a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x8d67db0b205e32a5dd96145f022fa18aae7dc8aa">0x8d67db0b205e32a5dd96145f022fa18aae7dc8aa</a></strong></p><p>Over 1700 ETH (around $3.3M) was forwarded to a secondary address: <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x3d32c5a2e592c7b17e16bddc87eab75f33ae3010">0x3d32c5a2e592c7b17e16bddc87eab75f33ae3010</a></p><p>Exploit tx (1st attack): <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x8b74995d1d61d3d7547575649136b8765acb22882960f0636941c44ec7bbe146">0x8b74995d…</a></p><p>Original failed tx (1st attack): <a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x97a8315e942dd180fb90a17b92f7dabd6e8a2e5b9fd5e4a95ee4049ff33d2f16">0x97a8315e…</a></p><p>Original exploiter address (1st attack): <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0x10db234e02c3889d8e408c7084e8ce10892bdad7">0x10db234e02c3889d8e408c7084e8ce10892bdad7</a></p><hr/><p><strong>The second attack was somewhat simpler and far <a href="https://twitter.com/CurveCap/status/1682492113001275392">less damaging</a>, apart from to Conic’s reputation.
