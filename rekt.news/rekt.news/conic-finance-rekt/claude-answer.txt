Message:  Based on the details provided, the first attack exploited a read-only reentrancy vulnerability in the Conic Finance oracle contract CurveLPOracleV2. Specifically:

- Due to the vulnerability, the attacker could reenter the rETH-f.totalSupply() and other token methods like steCRV.totalSupply() multiple times.

- By reentering these methods, the attacker was able to manipulate the token prices/supplies used for pricing. 

- This allowed the attacker to withdraw more funds from Conic than they deposited by tricking the system into thinking more collateral was deposited.

The root cause was that Conic had reentrancy protection in place, but it did not trigger properly. The protection expected ETH to use address 0xeee..., but Curve actually uses the WETH token address. So the protection failed to detect the reentrant calls.

In summary, it was a reentrancy attack manipulating token pricing by reentering totalSupply() methods, made possible by a mismatch in expected token addresses that allowed the reentrancy to occur undetected.

The second attack took advantage of imbalanced Curve pools to extract value in a sandwich attack. There is enough detail provided on the specifics of that one in the post.
