Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided in the write-up, it seems the main vulnerability the attacker exploited was related to Tornado Cash's governance system. Specifically:

1) The attacker was able to deploy a malicious proposal contract using clever techniques to reset nonces and redeploy at the same address that had already been approved by governance. This allowed them to essentially trick the governance system into approving their malicious contract.

2) The malicious contract then assigned a large number of TORN tokens to addresses the attacker had created earlier. This gave the attacker over 1.2 million votes and full control over Tornado Cash's governance. 

3) The attacker was then able to use their control over governance to modify the router contract and gain admin privileges over deployed contracts.

So in summary, the key vulnerabilities were:

- The ability to reset nonces and redeploy contracts to approved addresses
- The governance system did not properly safeguard or limit votes
- Too much centralization of control to the governance system

The write-up provides excellent technical details on exactly how the exploit flowed. There is enough information provided to determine how the attack took place.
