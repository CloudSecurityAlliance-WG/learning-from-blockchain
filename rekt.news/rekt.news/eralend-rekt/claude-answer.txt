Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a read-only reentrancy bug in the EraLend lending platform's code. Specifically:

- EraLend was using recycled code from SyncSwap that had a vulnerable callback when burning LP tokens. 
- This callback allowed reading old reserve values before reserves were updated.
- The attacker was able to exploit this by burning LP tokens, invoking the callback to read old reserve values, and manipulating the price oracle to return an inflated price since it relied on the old, incorrect reserves.

The comment in the code even called out that reserves were not updated at that point, but this was not sufficient protection against reentrancy. So the core issues were:

1) A reentrant callback that read stale state
2) Manipulatable price oracle relying on that stale state
3) Ignoring the risk called out in comments rather than fixing it

This allowed the attacker to drain funds by tricking the protocol into thinking deposited collateral was worth more than it actually was.
