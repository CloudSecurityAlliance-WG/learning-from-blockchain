Status: SUCCESS
Message:  Unfortunately, there are not enough technical details provided in the text to determine exactly how the attacks were carried out. 

The text mentions that the attacks on Cheese Bank and Origin Protocol involved:

- Flash loans
- Fake tokens
- Re-entrancy

However, it does not provide specifics on how these elements were combined and exploited to steal funds.

Some possibilities based on the limited information:

- The attackers took out flash loans, used the borrowed funds to manipulate token prices or protocol states in some way, and then stole money before repaying the flash loans.

- Fake tokens were minted and deposited as collateral to borrow assets from the protocol.

- Re-entrancy was used to repeatedly call contract functions before state was updated properly.

But without more technical specifics on the exact attack vectors, contract vulnerabilities, etc., there is not enough information provided to determine precisely how the attacks took place.
