11-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there are not enough details provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The key pieces of information provided are:  - The attack targeted the NRV vault of Eleven Finance, allowing the attacker to drain funds from nrvBTC, nrvETH and nrvFUSDT balances.  - A vulnerable `emergencyBurn()` function in the intermediate vault contract allowed the attacker to withdraw deposited balances without proper accounting.  - The attacker used flash loans of underlying assets (BTCB, ETH, USDT) to mint the Nerve assets nrvBTC, nrvETH, nrvFUSDT and deposit them into the vulnerable contract.  - By calling `emergencyBurn()`, the attacker was able to withdraw the entire intermediate vault balance.  However, the exact details of how the `emergencyBurn()` function was exploited are not provided. There are no code snippets, specifics on input parameters or return values, or explanations of how balances were improperly tracked after `emergencyBurn()` was called.  Without these additional technical details, there is not enough information to conclusively determine the precise vulnerability and how the attack took place from a coding perspective.  In summary, the key phrase that applies here is: ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."" More specific technical details would be needed to fully analyze the attack vector. Please let me know if any additional information can be provided!"
8ight-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no technical details given about how the attack specifically took place. The article mentions:  - The protocol was a fork of Olympus - $1.75 million was taken - Funds were transferred from the protocol to Tornado Cash for anonymity - The developers falsely claimed to have multi-sig in place when they did not - The developers may have posted private keys on Facebook or in a Google Doc - Many are accusing the developers themselves of taking the funds  However, there are no technical details provided on the specific vulnerability or exploit used to steal the funds. The article suggests it could have been due to poor operational security (OPSEC) by the developers, but does not confirm how the attack took place from a technical standpoint.  Given the lack of technical details on the attack vector, I cannot conclusively determine how the attack took place. The article suggests it was likely due to very poor security practices by the developers, but does not provide enough specific technical information to know for certain."
abra-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the root cause of the exploit was a rounding error vulnerability in the CauldronV4 contracts used by Abracadabra. Specifically:  The borrow function was vulnerable to manipulation of the ""part"" parameter (the user's share of total debt) by repeatedly borrowing and repaying an asset. This took advantage of a rounding error that allowed the attacker to incorrectly calculate their debt.  This enabled the attacker to:  1. Flash loan MIM tokens 2. Deposit MIM tokens into BentoBox to enable the ERC-4626 ""first depositor"" vulnerability 3. Repay liabilities for other users 4. Repeatedly borrow and repay to inflate the share price (the ERC-4626 vulnerability) 5. Add collateral and borrow a large amount of MIM 6. Repay the flash loan and take profits  The resulting MIM dump by the attacker caused the depegging event.  In summary, the attack combined flash loans, manipulation of the ""part"" parameter via a rounding vulnerability, and ERC-4626 vulnerabilities to steal funds. The technical details provided give a clear picture of how the attack was executed."
agave-hundred-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attacks was a reentrancy vulnerability due to the design of the xDAI token, which contains the function callAfterTransfer().  Specifically:  - The xDAI token has a callAfterTransfer() function that allows reentrancy. This created a vulnerability in the lending protocols Agave and Hundred Finance that are built on the xDAI chain.  - The attacker exploited this by using flash loans to borrow assets repeatedly in a nested way before the protocols could update balances, essentially draining funds. This is similar to the reentrancy attack on Cream Finance mentioned.  - The post mortems highlight that even if you fork/copy strong code from established projects like Aave and Compound, new vulnerabilities can emerge in different environments. Key lessons being strict input vetting, following checks-effects-interactions coding patterns, and extensive auditing when bringing code to new chains.  So in summary, the root cause was the reentrancy vulnerability due to the callAfterTransfer() function in the xDAI token, which enabled the flash loan attacks on the lending protocols. The write-up has good technical detail on the specific attack flow."
akropolis-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the Akropolis protocol to steal $2 million in DAI tokens. Specifically:  1. The attacker created a malicious ERC-20 token contract.  2. They deposited this malicious token into the Akropolis protocol.  3. The deposit triggered a callback to the malicious token contract.  4. The callback reentered the Akropolis deposit function to make another deposit of 25k DAI tokens, supplied via a flash loan.  5. Because of the reentrant call, the Akropolis protocol incorrectly calculated the deposit amount and credited the attacker for 50k DAI instead of 25k.  6. The attacker withdrew the extra 25k DAI.  This attack relied on reentrancy - the ability of a contract to call back into the calling contract before the first invocation completes. This allowed the attacker to manipulate the deposit amount calculation. The flash loan provided the capital needed to deposit and exploit the vulnerability.  The key pieces of information that allowed me to determine this are:  - Mention of ""re-entrancy"" - The deposit amount being calculated as the difference before and after - The attack contract making an additional deposit via callback - Withdrawing double the actual deposit amount  So in summary, this was a reentrancy attack using a malicious token contract and flash loan. The details provided are sufficient to determine how it was executed."
alchemix-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are not enough technical details to determine exactly how the attack on Alchemix took place.  The key information provided is:  - Alchemix allowed users to deposit ETH and take out a loan in alETH (representing the future yield) - Some users discovered the protocol assigned them no debt when doing this - These users were able to withdraw their original ETH collateral while still holding the alETH they minted  So there was clearly some kind of vulnerability that allowed users to mint alETH without taking on debt, resulting in free alETH.  However, the post-mortem does not provide technical specifics on how this occurred from a coding/smart contract perspective.  Without more technical implementation details, I cannot determine the exact vulnerability or weakness that was exploited. The post focuses more on the aftermath and response rather than the root cause details.  So in summary - there is not enough information provided here to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that enabled attackers to execute this ""reverse rugpull."" More technical smart contract and implementation details would be needed."
alpha-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately there is not enough technical information provided in the incident write-up to determine exactly how the attack took place from a coding perspective.  The key points that can be gleaned are:  1) The attacker created a malicious ""spell"" (contract) that was able to manipulate debt calculations in the Alpha Homora protocol.  2) The attacker needed insider knowledge of an unreleased sUSD lending pool in the Alpha Homora V2 contracts in order to execute their attack.  3) There was a rounding error in the borrow function calculation that the attacker was able to exploit by being the sole borrower.  4) The attacker was able to increase the total debt without increasing the total debt share using the resolveReserve function.  5) Through a complex series of transactions, the attacker was able to repeatedly borrow sUSD tokens without the protocol registering it as real debt due to the manipulated debt shares.  So in summary, it involved insider knowledge, a malicious contract, and manipulation of debt calculations/shares - but the exact vulnerability in the code is not specified. The write-up focuses more on the sequence of transactions than the coding details that enabled the attack. I cannot determine the precise vulnerability from the information provided."
alphapo-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to conclusively determine how the attacker gained access to AlphaPo's hot wallet and drained the funds.  The article speculates that the hack was likely carried out by the Lazarus cybercriminal group using spearphishing techniques, but does not provide any confirmed details on how they actually compromised AlphaPo's systems.  Some key phrases that indicate a lack of specific technical details:  -""The phishing techniques used by sophisticated groups like Lazarus are varied and ever-evolving""  -""Stories of compromised hot wallets leave little to be said""  - ""But they always have a common goal""  So in summary, while the article analyzes the on-chain movement of the stolen funds, it does not reveal the specific vulnerability, exploit, or attack vector used to initially access the hot wallet and drain it. There simply is not enough technical information provided to make a definitive assessment."
ankr-helio-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a compromised private key:  The exploit was due to a private key compromise of the Ankr deployer address on BSC, potentially the result of a phishing campaign.  The compromised deployer account published a malicious version of the aBNBc token contract, which was then upgraded to replace the existing implementation.  So the attacker gained access to Ankr's deployer private key, likely through phishing. This gave them access to publish a malicious contract and upgrade the existing aBNBc token contract to include a backdoor minting function. This allowed them to freely mint a massive number of tokens to drain value from the project.  The post mortems from Peckshield and Beosin had warned about the risks from privileged accounts in the contracts, but Ankr unfortunately did not fix these issues. This allowed the attacker to exploit the deployer account once they had compromised its private key.  In summary, the attack vector was:  1. Compromise Ankr deployer private key (likely via phishing) 2. Use key to publish and upgrade malicious token contract 3. Add minting backdoor to new contract 4. Freely mint tokens and extract value  So the root cause was the private key compromise, which then enabled access to critically sensitive permissions in the contracts."
anyswap-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact details of how the attack took place. The key details that are missing are:  1. Technical specifics on the vulnerability in the ECDSA implementation used by Anyswap's V3 router that allowed the attacker to back-calculate the private key. The writeup mentions that the issue was repeat k-values in signatures, but does not provide the vulnerable code or describe how the attacker was able to exploit this to obtain the private key.  2. How the attacker gained access to sign transactions with the compromised private key. The writeup shows the attacker draining funds after compromising the key, but does not describe how they signed the draining transactions.  So in summary, while the writeup gives a high-level description of an ECDSA vulnerability being exploited to obtain a private key, and shows the aftermath of funds being drained, it does not provide the crucial technical details to understand exactly how the attack took place. More specific information about the vulnerable ECDSA implementation and how the attacker turned the compromised key into a loss of funds is needed."
arbix-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no clear technical details about how the attack was executed. The write-up states that the project ""drained the vaults of users' funds"", but does not provide specifics on how this was done from a technical perspective.  Some key points:  - The project deleted their website, Twitter, and Telegram, indicating it was likely an insider attack/rug pull rather than an external hack.  - Funds were drained directly from the vaults and sent to an address controlled by the attackers. But there are no technical details provided on how access to the vaults was obtained.  - 4.5M ARBX tokens were minted and sold off, tanking the price. This indicates possible access to minting capabilities.  - Funds were bridged from BSC to Ethereum and converted to ETH by the attackers.  Overall there is simply not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness exploited. It appears funds were accessed in an unauthorized way, but the exact attack vector is unclear. For example, there's no mention of a smart contract exploit. At most all we can determine is it was likely an insider rug pull rather than an external attack. So at this point I would have to conclude there is not enough information to determine how the attack took place from a technical perspective. Please let me know if any additional details from the write-up could aid analysis."
ascendex-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the markdown text to determine exactly how the attacker compromised AscendEX's hot wallet and stole the funds.  The text mentions that AscendEX claimed their private keys were ""compromised"" but provides no details on how this occurred. It could have been the result of a security vulnerability, insider threat, social engineering attack, or something else, but there are no specifics given.  Without more technical specifics on the attack vector, vulnerabilities exploited, or security failures, I cannot reliably determine how the attack took place. The text focuses more on the impact and aftermath rather than the actual mechanics of the attack.  So in summary:  There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place"
atlantis-loans-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the attacker exploited the Atlantis Loans decentralized governance system to gain control of the protocol's token contracts. Specifically:  1) The Atlantis Loans developers abandoned the project in April 2022, but left the protocol operational. This included paying for the UI hosting for 2 years.  2) On June 7th, the attacker submitted a malicious governance proposal #52.  3) The proposal granted the attacker control of Atlantis Loans' token contracts.  4) After the proposal passed, the attacker upgraded the token contracts with their own malicious versions.  5) These malicious contracts allowed the attacker to drain tokens from any address that still had active approvals to the old Atlantis Loans contracts.  So in summary, the vulnerability was the abandoned decentralized governance system that could still be abused to pass control to the attacker. The attacker then used this control to deploy malicious contracts and drain funds from unsuspecting users who still had active token approvals.  The key weaknesses were:  - Lack of ongoing maintenance/monitoring of the abandoned governance system - Users not revoking approvals after Atlantis Loans was abandoned - No security measures like time delays on governance proposals  Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
atomic-wallet-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no clear technical details given about the specific vulnerability or attack vector used to compromise Atomic Wallet.  The article mentions several possibilities that have been raised by security researchers:  - Vulnerabilities reported to Atomic Wallet in 2021 by auditors Least Authority, which were never fixed. No specifics are provided about these vulnerabilities.  - A BGP hijacking attack that may have intercepted and logged Atomic Wallet traffic. This alone would not have enabled the thefts, but could have been combined with other vulnerabilities. No confirmation is provided.  - A data leak similar to the Slope wallet incident, but again no confirmation.  Without more technical information from Atomic Wallet about the root cause, the article states that it's difficult for other wallet providers to check if they are vulnerable to the same attack.  The article also criticizes Atomic's poor security posture and refusal to engage with researchers who have reported issues to them.  In summary, the information provided does not contain enough specific technical details to determine precisely how the attacks took place. As the article states, the root cause is still unknown. The key phrase that sums this up is: ""While the root cause is still to be identified..."""
au-dodo-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the DODO V2 Crowdpooling smart contract that allows the init() function to be called multiple times. Here are the key steps the attacker took:  1. The attacker created a fake token and initialized the smart contract with it by calling init().  2. The attacker called sync() to set the token balance to 0.  3. The attacker called init() again, this time with a real token from DODO's pools.  4. The attacker used a flash loan to drain all the real tokens from the pools and bypass the flash loan check.  The ability to call init() multiple times allowed the attacker to trick the contract into thinking the fake token was legitimate, then replace it with a real token and drain the pools. This was possible due to the contract not preventing multiple init() calls.  In summary, the vulnerability was the lack of validation around init() being called multiple times, which allowed the attacker to manipulate token balances and drain funds."
audius-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to execute this attack was:  The attacker was able to take control of the Audius governance contract by exploiting a known issue with storage collisions between the AudiusAdminUpgradabilityProxy contract and the OpenZeppelin Initializable contract.  Specifically:  - The AudiusAdminUpgradabilityProxy contract sets the proxyAdmin address in storage slot 0.  - This creates a collision with the Initializable contract, which also uses storage slot 0.  - This allowed the attacker to reinitialize the Audius governance contract and take control of it by setting themself as the new admin.  - Once in control of the governance contract, the attacker could change parameters and increase their own voting power.  - They then used their increased voting power to pass a malicious proposal that transferred 18M AUDIO tokens from the treasury to their own address.  In summary, the vulnerability was a known storage collision issue that allowed the attacker to take control of the Audius governance contract and exploit it to steal funds."
autoshark-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the Autoshark protocol's reward minting mechanism. Specifically:  1. The attacker made a small deposit into the SHARK-BNB vault to establish a position.  2. They took out a large (100K BNB) flash loan from Pancakeswap.  3. They used 50K BNB from the flash loan to buy SHARK tokens, and sent the SHARK + remaining 50K BNB to the SharkMinter contract.  4. They called the getReward function on the SharkMinter contract with their deposit from step 1.  5. Because the SharkMinter contract saw a huge SHARK and BNB balance (from step 3), it incorrectly calculated an extremely large profit amount and minted 100M new SHARK tokens as a reward.  6. The attacker dumped the minted SHARK tokens to repay the flash loan.  In summary, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to artificially inflate the reward calculation by sending assets directly to the minter contract to manipulate its balance. This resulted in an excessive number of new SHARK tokens being minted as reward. There are enough technical details provided to determine the attack vector."
badger-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker compromised Badger DAO's front-end to insert additional token approvals that allowed the attacker to later drain user funds. Specifically:  - The attacker was able to manipulate Badger's front-end to show unusual token approvals when users attempted legitimate transactions like deposits and reward claims.  - These approvals allowed the attacker to increase their allowance to spend user tokens. Over 500 user addresses approved the attacker's address, granting them unlimited access to funds.  - Armed with these approvals, the attacker was then able to drain user funds, stealing $120 million in various coins. They transferred tokens directly from user wallets.  - An example transaction shows the attacker draining ~900 byvWBTC (worth over $50M) from a user that had approved the attacker's address to spend unlimited tokens just hours earlier.  So in summary, the attacker focused on compromising Badger's front-end to trick users into unknowingly granting broad token approvals, which enabled the theft. The front-end manipulation went undetected for at least 12 days. This highlights the need for projects to aggressively monitor for unauthorized changes to critical infrastructure like front-end code."
balancer-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the write-up to determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector used by the attacker.  The write-up mentions that the attacks targeted ""v2 Boosted pools"" on Ethereum, Optimism, and Fantom networks. It states that Balancer had disclosed a ""potential threat"" the previous week and advised users to withdraw funds from certain pools.  However, details of how the attack was actually carried out are not provided. The post-mortem from Balancer has apparently not yet been published. The write-up says ""details of the attack vector remain under wraps"" and that the article will be updated when more information is released.  Without knowing the precise vulnerability, it's impossible to explain technically how the attackers were able to steal the $2.1 million. There could be speculation about potential issues with the Boosted pools or price manipulation, but that would just be guesswork without more concrete details from Balancer about the root cause.  So in summary - there is simply not enough specific technical information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector. The best course is to await the pending post-mortem report from Balancer for the full details. Until then, we can't accurately explain the weakness the attackers exploited."
bald-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the BALD token's liquidity pool to profit at the expense of other users. Specifically:  1) The attacker set up the BALD token and added a significant amount of initial liquidity (~$12M) to pump up the price and attract other users to deposit funds.  2) After the price increased due to hype and FOMO, the attacker removed their liquidity, netting themselves $5.9M in profit. This drastically drained the liquidity pool and crashed the BALD price, ""rugging"" other users.  So in summary, the attacker used their position as the token deployer to profit from providing and removing liquidity. There is no evidence of a technical exploit - rather they took advantage of hype around the new token and market dynamics to extract profits in a ""rug pull."""
beanstalk-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the main vulnerability the attacker exploited was the ability to instantly execute a malicious governance proposal without any delay. Specifically:  1) The attacker prepared a malicious governance proposal (BIP-18) that would transfer all funds from the protocol to the attacker. This was made possible by the 1 day delay on governance actions, which allowed the proposal to be prepared in advance.  2) The attacker then used a flash loan to temporarily gain a majority of voting power in the protocol. This flash loan provided over $1 billion worth of assets that were added to liquidity pools with BEAN tokens to gain voting power.  3) With the temporary voting power, the attacker voted on and instantly executed the prepared BIP-18 proposal using the emergencyCommit function. This immediately transferred all funds (over $180 million) to the attacker.  4) The attacker then repaid the flash loans, kept $76 million in ETH, and sent the rest to Tornado Cash.  The key factors that enabled this attack were:  - Lack of a delay in executing governance proposals - Ability to temporarily gain voting power via flash loans - Emergency commit functionality that allowed instant execution  The report does provide enough technical details to determine how the attack took place through the vulnerabilities described above. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
bearn-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to exploit bEarnFi's BvaultsBank contract was an inconsistency in how the withdraw logic interpreted asset denominations between the BvaultsBank contract and its associated BvaultsStrategy contract.  Specifically:  - BvaultsBank's withdraw logic assumed withdrawn amounts were denominated in BUSD - BvaultsStrategy's withdraw logic assumed withdrawn amounts were denominated in ibBUSD - ibBUSD is an interest-bearing token that is more valuable than BUSD  This meant that when the attacker withdrew BUSD from BvaultsBank, BvaultsStrategy interpreted that as a larger ibBUSD withdrawal. This allowed the attacker to repeatedly deposit and withdraw to accumulate more assets than they deposited, until draining the pool.  The technical steps the attacker took were:  1. Borrow BUSD flash loan 2. Deposit into BvaultsBank (sent to BvaultsStrategy and yield farm) 3. Withdraw BUSD from BvaultsBank (treated by BvaultsStrategy as larger ibBUSD withdrawal) 4. Repeat deposit/withdraw to accumulate credits 5. Drain the pool 6. Return flash loan  So in summary, the root cause was the inconsistency in asset denomination handling between the two contracts, which the attacker was able to exploit through flash loans and repeated deposits/withdrawals."
belt-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was an incorrect share valuation in the Belt Finance protocol. Specifically:  1. The attacker was able to take out 8 flash loans worth a total of $385M in BUSD from PancakeSwap. Flash loans allow you to borrow without collateral, execute arbitrage/other actions, and pay back the loan within the same transaction.  2. They deposited some BUSD into the bEllipsisBUSD and bVenusBUSD lending strategies on Belt Finance. These were marked as the ""Most Undersubscribed"" strategies.  3. They swapped BUSD for USDT using the Ellipsis dex.  4. They withdrew more BUSD from the now ""Most Oversubscribed"" bVenusBUSD strategy.  5. They repeated steps 3-4 several times.  6. Finally, they paid back the flash loans while keeping the profits.  The key vulnerability appears to have been an incorrect share valuation in the Belt Finance lending strategies, which allowed the attacker to deposit/withdraw more funds than they should have been able to. This allowed them to arbitrage and extract profits. However, there are no further specifics provided on exactly how the improper share valuation was calculated or allowed the attack."
bent-finance,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability exploited was the ability for the Bent Finance team to manually adjust balances in the rewards contract. Specifically:  ""Bent Finance [cvxCRV contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x270b6aff561284ef380cdd6d8b036f4981049a86) was [updated](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xf711641ea9814d78780c8a51ad734ad44d58baf3f97256a3f5ec3200a29eadc7) on Nov. 30, manually adjusting the balance of the exploiter’s [address.](https://etherscan.io/address/0xd23cfffa066f81c7640e3f0dc8bb2958f7686d1f)""  This allowed the exploiter to assign themselves ""enormous amounts of rewards, far exceeding the TVL of Bent Finance itself.""  So in summary, the vulnerability was the centralized ability for the Bent Finance team to manually adjust balances. This seems to point to an inside job rather than a technical smart contract exploit."
bitmart-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it is unclear exactly how the attacker gained access to BitMart's hot wallets. The write-up states:  ""It remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question. Hopefully it wasn’t another basic OPSEC error such as granting unlimited approvals to an EOA, as in Celsius’ case.""  So the vulnerability or weakness used is currently unknown. There is speculation it could have been due to an ""OPSEC error"" like granting excessive permissions, but no confirmed details.  The key phrase indicating there is not enough information is:  ""It remains to be seen how the attacker managed to gain access to the wallets in question.""  So in summary:  There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place. More details are needed on the specific vulnerability exploited by the attacker to access BitMart's hot wallets. The write-up makes it clear the method is currently unknown pending further investigation."
bnb-bridge-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the way the Binance Bridge verified proofs from the Binance Beacon Chain. Specifically:  - The bridge uses ""vulnerable IAVL verification"" which the attacker was able to forge for block 110217401 from August 2020.  - As explained by samczsun, there was a bug that allowed the attacker to forge arbitrary messages by submitting falsified proofs of deposit from the Binance Beacon Chain.  - The attacker used this to forge two messages minting 1 million BNB each to their address.  So in summary, the vulnerability was in the bridge's verification of Beacon Chain proofs, which allowed the attacker to exploit it by forging fake deposit proofs to mint BNB tokens to themselves. The technical details of exactly how the IAVL verification was vulnerable are not provided, but the key issue was the bridge's inability to properly verify the authenticity of Beacon Chain proofs."
bondly-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the markdown text to determine exactly how the attack took place.  The key pieces of information provided are:  - An attacker was able to mint 373 million new BONDLY tokens and dump them on the market, causing the price to crash.  - The minting happened from address 0x58a058ca4b1b2b183077e830bc929b5eb0d3330c.  - Funds were then sent to Tornado Cash for mixing by address 0xc433d50dd0614c81ee314289ec82aa63710d25e8, which is presumed to be the attacker's wallet.  However, there are no details provided on the specific vulnerability or weaknesses in the Bondly Finance platform/contracts that enabled this attack.  Some possibilities that could potentially explain it:  - A flaw in the token minting logic that allowed unlimited minting - Compromise of an administrative key/account that was able to mint new tokens - An access control issue that allowed the attacker to gain minting rights  But without further technical information on the Bondly contracts and architecture, there is not enough detail provided in the post to conclusively determine the exact attack vector utilized."
bonq-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the main vulnerability exploited was the ability for the attacker to manually update the price feed for the wrapped ALBT (WALBT) collateral asset using the Tellor oracle. Specifically:  1. The attacker staked 10 TRB tokens worth about $175 to meet the minimum staking requirement for submitting price updates.  2. The attacker then called the submitValue function of the TellorFlex contract to submit a hugely inflated price for WALBT (50000000000000000000000000000000 according to the report).  3. Because BonqDAO uses the instant reported value from the Tellor oracle rather than a time-averaged price, this immediately updated the collateral value.  4. The attacker then borrowed 100M BEUR stablecoins against just 0.1 WALBT collateral due to the inflated collateral price.  5. In a follow up transaction, the attacker reset the WALBT price extremely low, allowing them to liquidate other users' WALBT collateral for a low cost.  In summary, the main issues were:  - The Tellor oracle allowed the attacker to manually set the price with a small stake rather than using an aggregated price feed.  - BonqDAO trusted the instant price from the oracle without additional validation.  - This allowed the attacker to manipulate the collateral value to exploit the lending protocol.  The report provides clear technical details on how the attack took place via manipulating the Tellor oracle price feed. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
burgerswap-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack on BurgerSwap.  The write-up mentions that the attack was made possible because the attacker could do a reentrance attack and make a second swap before reserves were updated. This allowed the attacker to get more tokens out than they put in. However, the details of how the attacker was able to conduct the reentrance attack are not provided.  The write-up also mentions that a check for x*y=k that is present in the UniSwap code was seemingly removed from the BurgerSwap code. The removal of this check would allow an attacker to trigger a swap of any output size while only paying a small input. However, there are no code snippets or other technical specifics showing exactly where or how this check was removed from the BurgerSwap contracts.  So in summary, while the write-up provides some hints at potential vulnerabilities, there is not enough specific technical information provided to conclusively determine the exact weakness or vulnerabilities the attacker exploited. To make that determination, we would need to see more technical details like contract code snippets, details on the reentrance attack flow, specifics on removed validation checks, etc. So unfortunately I cannot provide a more definitive assessment without additional details on the attack vector. Please let me know if any further attack specifics can be provided."
bzx-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability or weakness the attacker used was:  A bZx developer was sent a phishing email with a malicious Word document macro that when opened, compromised the private keys to the developer's personal wallet. This wallet had access/control over the bZx contracts on Polygon and BSC. By gaining access to this wallet, the attacker was able to drain funds from the bZx contracts on those chains.  So in summary: - The attack vector was a phishing email that compromised a developer's private keys - This gave the attacker access to bZx contracts on Polygon and BSC which they drained of funds  The code itself does not seem to have been compromised. Rather, the weakness was that a single developer wallet had too much control/access. So while human error and phishing were involved, the larger vulnerability was inadequate key management and separation of duties within bZx."
cashio-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the root cause of the vulnerability that enabled the infinite mint attack on Cashio was an incomplete validation system for collateral deposits. Specifically:  - Cashio's contract only validated that collateral token deposits were the same type of tokens held by the contract, but did not validate the "".mint"" field of LP tokens deposited via the saber_swap.arrow contract.  - This allowed the hacker to create a fake root contract and a chain of fake token accounts that would pass the incomplete validation checks.  - The hacker was then able to use their fake tokens as collateral to mint a massive amount of CASH tokens.  So in summary, the lack of proper validation of the collateral token contract's minting mechanism enabled the attack. The hacker exploited this by creating fake token contracts that appeared valid to the incomplete validation logic."
chainswap-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The key pieces of information provided are:  - The attacker was able to exploit a Factory contract on the Ethereum network to mint tokens directly into different addresses.  - The attack involved calling the receive function on the Factory contract and dodging an authentication check using a new address signature for each transaction.  - A charge fee of 0.005 ETH was paid for each minting transaction.  - The minted tokens were then bridged to BSC and sold for WBNB.  However, without more specifics on the vulnerable contract code, how the authentication check was bypassed, or the precise minting and bridging mechanisms used, I cannot reliably describe the full technical details behind the attack vector.  In summary: ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."" More technical specifics would be needed to analyze the vulnerability. Please let me know if any additional attack details become available!"
coinex-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no clear technical details about how the CoinEx hack specifically occurred.  The article mentions that CoinEx has not yet announced how the security breach happened. It states that attackers were able to drain funds from CoinEx's hot wallets, indicating a compromise of private keys or improper security controls.  Some key pieces of information that would help determine the exact vulnerability used:  - How the private keys were stored and accessed. Were they encrypted properly? Was there an insider threat?  - What permissions did the compromised keys have? Full withdrawal rights?  - Were there any secondary approvals or controls bypass?  - Were there any phishing attempts on employees?  Without more specific details from CoinEx on their infrastructure and security controls, there is not enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place. The article provides excellent background and impact details but lacks the technical specificity needed. I will refrain from speculating beyond what has been confirmed."
compound-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are not enough technical details to determine exactly how the attack was executed.  The key points from the write-up are:  - There was a vulnerability in the updated Compound Comptroller vault that allowed wrongful distribution of $80M in excess COMP tokens.  - The Comptroller vault is refilled with 0.5 COMP per block from a Reservoir contract. At the time of the first incident, the Reservoir had not been drained in 2 months and contained over 200k COMP (~$68M).  - 3.5 days after the initial incident, someone called the drip() function on the Reservoir contract. This refilled the vulnerable Comptroller and allowed another $68.8M to be wrongly distributed.  However, the exact vulnerability or weakness that was exploited is not provided. The write-up does not give technical details on how calling drip() or interacting with the Comptroller allowed the wrongful COMP distribution.  So in summary, while we know additional funds were stolen by refilling and re-exploiting a vulnerability in the Comptroller contract, there is insufficient technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or attack vector used."
conic-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the first attack exploited a read-only reentrancy vulnerability in the Conic Finance oracle contract CurveLPOracleV2. Specifically:  - Due to the vulnerability, the attacker could reenter the rETH-f.totalSupply() and other token methods like steCRV.totalSupply() multiple times.  - By reentering these methods, the attacker was able to manipulate the token prices/supplies used for pricing.  - This allowed the attacker to withdraw more funds from Conic than they deposited by tricking the system into thinking more collateral was deposited.  The root cause was that Conic had reentrancy protection in place, but it did not trigger properly. The protection expected ETH to use address 0xeee..., but Curve actually uses the WETH token address. So the protection failed to detect the reentrant calls.  In summary, it was a reentrancy attack manipulating token pricing by reentering totalSupply() methods, made possible by a mismatch in expected token addresses that allowed the reentrancy to occur undetected.  The second attack took advantage of imbalanced Curve pools to extract value in a sandwich attack. There is enough detail provided on the specifics of that one in the post."
cover-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was an infinite mint loophole in the Cover Protocol's smart contracts. Specifically:  - A new Balancer pool was added to the Cover Protocol's ""Blacksmith"" contract, likely introducing the vulnerability.  - An attacker deposited some tokens into this contract.  - The attacker then called the ""withdraw()"" function, exploiting the contract to mint a large number of COVER tokens, worth about $703 at the time.  - The attacker sold the exploited COVER tokens on the market.  - The attacker continued minting more COVER tokens while the vulnerability was still present, stealing around $4.4 million in total.  So in summary, the attack exploited an infinite mint vulnerability introduced in a new Balancer pool integration. By depositing tokens and calling withdraw(), the attacker could mint arbitrary amounts of COVER tokens.  The post-mortem indicates this was possible due to an issue with storage/memory in the contract. But there are no further technical details provided on the specific vulnerability. So while the high-level attack is clear, the underlying coding flaw that enabled it is not described."
cream-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to conclusively determine how the attack on Cream Finance took place.  The key pieces of information that are missing are:  1. Technical details on the specific vulnerability in the AMP token contract that enabled reentrancy. The write-up mentions that the AMP token uses ERC77-based ERC1820 which has a callPreTransferHooks function that enabled reentrancy, but does not specify the vulnerable code.  2. Technical specifics on how the attacker exploited the reentrancy vulnerability to steal funds. The steps listed describe the general flow of stealing WETH collateral, borrowing AMP tokens, exploiting the reentrancy bug, and liquidating part of the loan. But the exact vulnerability code and sequence of reentrant calls is not shown.  Without those technical specifics on the vulnerable contract code and exact exploit transaction flow, there is not enough information to fully determine how the attack took place from a technical perspective.  In summary, the key phrase that applies here is: ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."" More specific technical details would be needed to fully analyze the vector and provide a conclusive explanation. Please let me know if any additional details can be provided."
cream-rekt-2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker took advantage of a pricing vulnerability in Cream Finance's internal PriceOracleProxy for yUSDVault tokens. Specifically:  1. The attacker manipulated the price of yUSDVault tokens by first redeeming a large amount of yUSDVault for the underlying yUSD, drastically reducing the yUSDVault totalSupply.  2. They then made a small yUSD deposit back into the yUSDVault, which led the PriceOracleProxy to incorrectly increase the price of yUSDVault by around a factor of two.  3. This allowed the attacker to use their now overvalued yUSDVault tokens as collateral on Cream Finance to borrow assets from lending pools and default on the loans.  So in summary, the vulnerability was in the yUSDVault price oracle logic, which did not properly account for sudden large changes in totalSupply when determining the yUSDVault price. This allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their collateral value and drain lending pools.  The write-up provides detailed steps on how the manipulation was executed using flash loans, repeated lending and borrowing, and transfer of funds across two addresses controlled by the attacker."
crema-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was:  ""The attack was made possible due to faulty owner validation on one of the protocol’s accounts storing price tick data. These data are used by Crema to calculate LP fees.  The hacker created a false tick account, with fake data, and used flash loans to add liquidity to the protocol. They could then withdraw the liquidity and claim the fees they were “owed” according to their own contract’s data.""  So in summary:  1. There was insufficient validation of the price tick data accounts used to calculate LP fees. 2. The attacker created a fake price tick account with false data. 3. The attacker used flash loans to add and withdraw liquidity, claiming excessive LP fees based on the false data in their fake account.  The key weaknesses were the lack of proper ownership and data validation on critical accounts used to determine LP fee payouts. This allowed the attacker to spoof data and claim fees they were not actually owed.  There appears to be enough technical detail provided to determine how the attack took place. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
cryptocom-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no clear details about exactly how the attacker was able to bypass 2FA and email withdrawal approvals to drain user wallets.  The write-up states that:  - Hundreds of Crypto.com users had their wallets drained of at least 4.6K ETH (worth about $15M) - The funds were sent to Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency tumbler/mixer - The attacker somehow bypassed existing 2FA and withdrawal whitelists that should have prevented unauthorized withdrawals  However, there is no technical explanation of the specific vulnerability or attack vector used. The article leaves it as an open question:  ""How did the attacker bypass users 2FA, and their email withdrawal approvals?""  And later:  ""The hacker bypassed existing 2FA, they bypassed the withdrawal whitelist, could this attack really have come from outside?""  So in summary, while it's clear that a serious exploit allowed the bypassing of security mechanisms and theft of user funds, the write-up does not contain enough specific technical details to determine exactly how the attack took place. There is speculation about the security mechanisms that were compromised, but no clear explanation of the methods used or vulnerabilities exploited."
curve-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the attack relied on a DNS hijacking/compromise rather than an exploit of a vulnerability in the blockchain protocol itself:  The key details are:  - Curve Finance's front end website curve.fi suffered a DNS hijacking, redirecting users to a malicious site.  - Curve believes the underlying nameserver was compromised by the domain registrar iwantmyname, rather than an account-level breach.  - The malicious site prompted users to approve a malicious contract, which stole funds from approving users.  - Over $575k was stolen from users this way.  - The exploit did not affect curve.exchange, Curve's alternate front end website.  So in summary, the attacker compromised the nameserver or DNS records of curve.fi to hijack traffic and direct it to their malicious duplicate site, tricking users into approving the malicious contract. This seems to be a DNS attack rather than an on-chain or smart contract vulnerability.  The write-up does not contain enough technical details to determine the exact method used to compromise the nameserver or DNS records. But a DNS hijack rather than an on-chain vulnerability enabled the attack. Please let me know if any part of this analysis needs clarification!"
curve-vyper-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was:  A 0-day compiler bug in certain older versions of Vyper (0.2.15, 0.2.16 and 0.3.0), the language Curve's contracts are written in. Specifically, there was a misalignment of storage slots between two functions (add_liquidity and remove_liquidity) which causes a malfunction in the nonreentrant guard. This allows the attacker to re-enter the transaction between these two functions in order to manipulate LP token prices and drain the pool.  So in summary:  - The root cause was a compiler-level bug in Vyper - It caused a malfunction in the nonreentrant guard due to a storage slot misalignment - This enabled reentrancy between two functions to manipulate prices and drain funds  The key vulnerabilities were the compiler bug and the resulting reentrancy it enabled. The write-up has enough technical details to determine this."
daomaker-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in DAO Maker's init() function, which allowed them to reinitialize token contracts with malicious data. Specifically:  1. The init() function was left vulnerable, allowing the attacker to reinitialize 4 token contracts (0x6e70c88be1d5c2a4c0c8205764d01abe6a3d2e22, 0xd6c8dd834abeeefa7a663c1265ce840ca457b1ec, 0xdd571023d95ff6ce5716bf112ccb752e86212167, 0xa43b89d5e7951d410585360f6808133e8b919289) with malicious data.  2. After reinitializing the contracts, the attacker then used the emergencyExit() function to withdraw funds from each contract.  3. The attacker went on to sell the stolen tokens on 1inch and MetaMask Swap Router for DAI.  So in summary, the vulnerability was in the init() function which allowed the attacker to reinitialize token contracts and set malicious data. The attacker then used the emergencyExit() function to steal funds. After stealing the funds, they sold the tokens on DEXes."
deathbed-confessions-c3pr,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the withdraw() functions of the 7 malicious Strategy contracts that were added to the codebase after the initial audit.  Specifically:  1. The attacker deployed 7 malicious Strategy contracts with manipulated withdraw() functions that lacked checks to prevent unauthorized withdrawals.  2. Through the Controller contract, the attacker set and approved these 7 malicious Strategies.  3. The attacker then called the inCaseStrategyTokenGetStuck() function on the Controller contract. This abused the lack of checks in the malicious Strategies' withdraw() functions to transfer tokens from those Strategies into the Controller contract.  4. Finally, the attacker called the inCaseTokensGetStuck() function on the Controller to transfer the tokens into their own wallet, rug pulling the funds.  So in summary, the vulnerability was the ability for the attacker to deploy malicious contract logic with insufficient security checks after the initial audit, allowing them to bypass authorization and withdraw user funds into their own account. The key weakness that enabled this was the centralized control/upgradability that the developer retained over critical contract components.  Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
defilabs-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided in the markdown text, the attacker used a backdoor function in the DeFiLabs staking contract to drain user funds. Specifically:  - The vPoolv6 contract contained a withdrawFunds function that allowed the exploiter address (0xee08d6c3a983eb22d7137022f0e9f5e7d4cf0be2) to withdraw all user deposits from the contract.  - This is shown in the code snippet included, which has the withdrawFunds function allowing the owner (the exploiter address) to withdraw any token from the contract.  - Over $1.6 million in various tokens were drained from the contract via this withdrawFunds backdoor, including BSC-USD, CAKE, WBTC, WETH, and BUSD.  - An example transaction showing the funds being withdrawn is also provided.  So in summary, the attacker exploited a withdrawFunds backdoor function intentionally left in the vPoolv6 staking contract by the DeFiLabs team, allowing them to rug user funds. No sophisticated hack was required since the contract functionality allowed the draining of deposits."
dego-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack on Dego Finance.  The text states that Dego Finance claimed this was a case of ""compromised keys"", but does not provide any details about how the attacker actually gained access to or compromised those keys.  Some possibilities that could lead to compromised keys include:  - A weakness or vulnerability in the key management system used by Dego Finance that allowed the attacker to steal private keys - Social engineering attacks that tricked a Dego Finance developer or team member into giving up private keys - Malware or other intrusion that gained access to Dego Finance's systems and stole private keys - Insider threat from a malicious employee or developer with access to private keys  Without more technical details about the attack vector, the specific vulnerability exploited is unclear. The text does point out Dego Finance's lack of multi-signature schemes to protect keys as a weakness. But the root cause that allowed the attacker initial access is not provided.  In summary, there is insufficient information in the text to determine the specific vulnerability the attacker leveraged to compromise Dego Finance's keys and drain funds. More details would be needed to understand how access was first gained."
deribit-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no technical details about how the attacker gained access to Deribit's hot wallets or compromised the private keys. The post simply states that funds were taken from Deribit's hot wallets on Ethereum and Bitcoin, and provides the attacker's receiving addresses where the stolen funds were sent.  The post speculates that it could have been due to a phishing attack that compromised employee credentials or private keys, but there is no evidence provided to confirm that. Phishing is a common vector for these types of attacks.  Without more technical information or confirmation from Deribit on how the attack took place, there is not enough information to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that was exploited. The key phrase that sums this up is:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place.""  If more details emerge later on the root cause or method used by the attacker, then a more definitive assessment could be provided. But based on the currently available information in the post, there are no confirmed technical details about the specific attack vector."
deus-dao-r3kt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a misconfiguration in the Deus DAO DEI token contract's `burnFrom` function. Specifically:  - The `burnFrom` function had its `msgSender` and `account` parameters written in the wrong order. - This allowed the attacker to: - Set a large token approval for any DEI holder's address - Call `burnFrom` with amount = 0 and the DEI holder's address - This granted approval for all of that holder's tokens to the attacker's address - The attacker could then drain the funds using `transferFrom`  So in summary, the vulnerability was the incorrect parameter order in the `burnFrom` function, which allowed the attacker to manipulate token approvals and transfer user funds to themselves. This seems like a simple yet devastating implementation bug."
deus-dao-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it appears the attacker exploited a vulnerability with the price oracle used by the Deus Finance lending contract. Specifically:  - The Deus lending contract uses the Solidex USDC/DEI pool as a price oracle to determine the collateral value of loans - The attacker took out a flash loan of 24,772,798 DEI tokens from this USDC/DEI pool - By borrowing this large amount of DEI, the attacker was able to temporarily manipulate the price of the DEI/USDC pair - This manipulated price made many users' collateral insolvent according to the lending platform's calculations - The attacker's contract then liquidated these newly insolvent positions - After liquidating positions and profiting ~$3M, the attacker repaid the flash loan  So in summary, the vulnerability was the lending platform's reliance on a manipulable price oracle that could be exploited using a flash loan to artificially change asset prices. More robust, decentralized price oracle solutions may have prevented this attack."
deus-dao-rekt-2,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to definitively determine how the attack took place.  The key pieces of information that are missing include:  1. The exact details of the ""zero-day exploit on Solidly swaps"" that allowed the attacker to manipulate the Muon oracle's view of the USDC/DEI price. The article mentions using flash swaps in some way but does not provide specifics.  2. How the attacker was able to replicate the price manipulation of the on-chain USDC/DEI pool that was used in the previous attack last month. The steps of the attack are summarized at a high level but the technical details of how the price manipulation was achieved are not provided.  3. How the attacker was able to connect the manipulated prices from the two oracles (Muon off-chain and on-chain USDC/DEI pool) to trick the Deus lending platform. The relationship and integration details between the oracles and lending platform are not covered.  So in summary, while the article provides a good high-level overview of the incident, there are several critical technical gaps that prevent a definitive assessment of how each component of the attack was executed from an exploit and vulnerability perspective. Given the missing details, I cannot reliably determine the full attack flow."
dexible-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to steal funds from Dexible was an lack of input validation in the selfSwap function. Specifically:  - The selfSwap function allows users to define custom routing for swaps by specifying a ""router address"" and data to send to that address.  - However, the contract did not verify that the router address was actually a DEX contract.  - The attacker exploited this by specifying a token contract address as the router, and crafting the data to call the transferFrom function to steal tokens.  So in summary, the vulnerability was:  1. selfSwap allows custom router without verifying it is a DEX 2. Attacker provided token contract address as router 3. Attacker crafted data to call transferFrom on token contract to steal funds  This allowed the attacker to bypass the expected swap behavior and directly steal tokens from Dexible. Performing input validation on the router address by checking it against an allowlist of DEX contracts could have prevented this attack."
dforce-network-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the exploit used a known vulnerability called a ""read-only reentrancy vulnerability"" in some Curve pools. Specifically:  - The attacker used flash loaned funds to deposit into Curve's wstETH/ETH pool and get LP tokens - They deposited the LP tokens into a dForce vault (wstETHCRV-gauge) - When calling the remove_liquidity function, the attacker's contract was able to exploit the reentrancy vulnerability to manipulate the virtual price of the wstETHCRV-gauge tokens - dForce uses the virtual price from Curve as an oracle for the value of the wstETHCRV-gauge tokens - By manipulating the virtual price, the attacker was able to trick dForce into letting them liquidate other users' collateral at a profit  So in summary, the attacker exploited a known reentrancy vulnerability in Curve to manipulate pricing data that dForce relies on to liquidate collateral. This allowed them to steal funds from dForce vaults.  The key weaknesses were:  1) The reentrancy vulnerability in Curve allowing manipulation of virtual pricing 2) dForce using the virtual pricing from Curve directly without additional protections  Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
dydx-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems this attack involved manipulation of the YFI token price in order to liquidate positions on dYdX and drain funds from dYdX's insurance pool. Specifically:  - A single actor built up a large open interest long position in YFI on dYdX over the past few days, accounting for most of the YFI open interest - This same actor or a different actor then intentionally crashed the YFI spot price on exchanges. This triggered liquidations of the large YFI long positions on dYdX - The liquidations drained $9M from dYdX's insurance fund that is used to cover liquidation shortfalls  So in summary, the key vulnerability exploited was the ability to manipulate the YFI spot price to intentionally trigger liquidations on dYdX and profit from draining the insurance fund. The technical mechanics involved building up a large directional derivatives position and then moving the spot price against that position.  Some key phrases from the write-up that support this:  ""this was an intentional market manipulation attempt by a well capitalized actor(s) designed to drain funds from the dYdX insurance pool""  ""the $YFI price crash in the spot market seems like an intentional effort by a single actor (unsure whether the same or different one) to target the large OI on dYdX""  Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
easyfi-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the vulnerability or weakness that enabled the attacker to execute this attack is not clearly described.  The post mentions that the hacker ""used very sophisticated techniques"" and compromised a machine that was used solely for official transfers and had access to a key that could drain all the liquidity. However, it does not provide technical details on how the machine was compromised or what specific vulnerability was exploited.  The founder compares it to the Nexus Mutual case where a compromised machine led to loss of funds. But again, it does not say how the machine was compromised.  There is criticism of the poor OPSEC used by the founders - having a single admin key capable of draining funds with no timelock or multisig. But this seems more an issue of poor security practices rather than the specific vulnerability the hacker exploited.  The post says they await a more detailed post-mortem from the founder to explain how the attack took place. As of now, there is not enough technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that enabled the attack.  In summary:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."" More details are needed on how the hacker gained access to the founder's machine/key to carry out the theft. The poor security practices like having a single admin key are highlighted, but the post does not reveal the entry point or exploit used by the attacker."
elephant-money-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the attacker exploited a price manipulation vulnerability in the Elephant Money protocol to profit from flash loans. Specifically:  - The attacker took out large flash loans of WBNB and BUSD.  - They used the WBNB flash loan to mass purchase ELEPHANT tokens, drastically increasing the ELEPHANT price.  - They then minted the stablecoin TRUNK by depositing BUSD. The TRUNK minting process further raised the ELEPHANT price by using deposited BUSD to purchase more ELEPHANT. This benefited the attacker's existing ELEPHANT position.  - The attacker swapped their now much more valuable ELEPHANT back to WBNB, earning a large profit. They also redeemed their freshly minted TRUNK for additional WBNB profits.  - After repaying the original flash loans, the attacker was left with ~$4M profit.  - They repeated this cycle multiple times to accumulate over $11M in profits.  The core vulnerabilities were:  1) The ability to manipulate ELEPHANT price via large temporary WBNB purchases.  2) A flawed TRUNK minting model that could be gamed to further increase ELEPHANT price.  The attacker cleverly combined flash loans and price manipulation to exploit these issues for profit."
eminence-rekt-in-prod,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the article to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The article mentions that the attack involved:  - Using a flash loan to mint EMN tokens - Manipulating the EMN price downwards by burning EMN tokens for eTokens - Shorting EMN tokens by burning flashed EMN tokens back into DAI  However, it does not provide the smart contract code or explain the specific vulnerability that was exploited.  Without more technical details about the contracts and transactions involved, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability that was used to drain the $15 million. The article focuses more on the aftermath and impact of the attack rather than the technical details.  So in summary - there is not enough information provided in this write-up to technically determine how the attack took place. More specifics around the contracts, transactions, and mechanics of the attack would be needed. But the article does suggest it involved flash loans, price manipulation, and shorting tokens in some capacity."
epic-hack-homie,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack.  The key details that are missing are:  1. How the attacker gained access to the private keys for Kucoin's hot wallets. The write-up states this was done through ""access to the hot wallet private key rather than a brute force attack"", but does not explain how this access was obtained.  2. Whether there was a vulnerability on Kucoin's end (e.g. a flaw in their key management system, access controls, infrastructure configuration) that enabled the unauthorized access, or if it was through social engineering, insider threat, or some other vector.  Without knowing how the attacker gained the initial unauthorized access, it is impossible to point to the specific vulnerability, weakness or attack vector.  The write-up does say that ""relatively unadvanced techniques"" were used to launder the funds after the unauthorized access occurred. This suggests that the initial access/key compromise itself may have been the critical flaw, rather than an advanced crypto-specific attack. But there are still too few technical specifics provided to determine exactly how it happened based on the information given.  In summary, while a lot of helpful background is provided on the incident response and aftermath, there is not enough detail revealed here regarding the initial intrusion to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness exploited. Please let me know if any clarifying details can be provided."
eralend-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a read-only reentrancy bug in the EraLend lending platform's code. Specifically:  - EraLend was using recycled code from SyncSwap that had a vulnerable callback when burning LP tokens. - This callback allowed reading old reserve values before reserves were updated. - The attacker was able to exploit this by burning LP tokens, invoking the callback to read old reserve values, and manipulating the price oracle to return an inflated price since it relied on the old, incorrect reserves.  The comment in the code even called out that reserves were not updated at that point, but this was not sufficient protection against reentrancy. So the core issues were:  1) A reentrant callback that read stale state 2) Manipulatable price oracle relying on that stale state 3) Ignoring the risk called out in comments rather than fixing it  This allowed the attacker to drain funds by tricking the protocol into thinking deposited collateral was worth more than it actually was."
euler-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Euler Finance's donateToReserves function which allows users to donate eTokens (collateral) directly to Euler's reserves. This function did not properly check the health of the donator's debt position.  The key steps of the attack were:  1. The attacker used flash loans and Euler's leverage system to open a large underwater position on one contract, incurring bad debt via donateToReserves.  2. On a separate liquidator contract, the attacker was then able to liquidate the inflated eToken collateral from the first contract at a discount.  3. The liquidator contract withdrew the exploited funds into the underlying assets (ETH, WBTC, USDC, DAI).  In summary, the lack of debt position checks in donateToReserves allowed the attacker to artificially create bad debt that would not get liquidated. This permitted the withdrawal of unbacked funds.  The provided information clearly outlines how the attack took place, exploiting the donateToReserves vulnerability. There is enough technical detail to understand the key steps involved."
exactly-protocol-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to exploit Exactly Protocol was an insufficient check in the DebtManager contract regarding whether the market address passed was valid.  Specifically, the DebtManager contract did not properly verify that the market address passed to it was a valid market. This allowed the attacker to pass a fake market address, while inserting the victim's address as _msgSender. This resulted in users' collateral being drained.  The key pieces of information that reveal this are:  1) ""The attack was made possible due to an insufficient check in the DebtManager contract ([proxy](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x675d410dcf6f343219AAe8d1DDE0BFAB46f52106), [implementation](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/address/0x16748Cb753A68329cA2117a7647aA590317EbF41#code)) as to whether the market address was valid.""  2) ""This allowed the hacker to pass a fake market address, inserting the victim’s address as _msgSender, and thereby drain users’ collateral.""  3) The provided code snippet showing the vulnerability in the DebtManager contract.  So in summary, the attack worked by exploiting insufficient validation of the market address parameter, allowing the attacker to manipulate it and drain collateral to their own address. The technical details provided make this clear."
fei-rari-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to drain funds from Rari's Fuse pools was a reentrancy issue due to the Compound protocol code used in these pools not following the check-effect-interaction pattern. Specifically:  - Rari uses forked Compound code in its Fuse pools that is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This code does not properly follow the check-effect-interaction pattern.  - The ""borrow()"" function in this Compound code transfers ETH to the attacker's contract before updating the attacker's actual borrow records.  - This allowed the attacker to make a reentrant call to the ""exitMarket()"" function via the fallback function after borrowing ETH but before the borrow record was updated.  - The ""exitMarket()"" function allows the attacker to withdraw their deposited collateral (in this case 150M USDC).  - So the attacker was able to borrow ETH, withdraw their collateral due to the reentrancy, and keep the borrowed ETH, draining funds from the pools.  The step-by-step analysis shows how the attacker exploited this reentrancy vulnerability specifically using the ""borrow()"" and ""exitMarket()"" functions and the lack of proper checks before effects."
fortress-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the main vulnerability that enabled the attack was a weakness in the price oracle system. Specifically:  - The price submit() function was publicly callable, allowing the attacker to manipulate price data.  - This manipulated price data, combined with the malicious governance proposal to add FTS as collateral with an extremely high collateral factor, allowed the attacker to drain assets using very little FTS collateral.  So in summary, the attack took advantage of:  1. A vulnerable price oracle that could be manipulated by calling the public submit() function.  2. A malicious governance proposal that set a high collateral factor for FTS.  3. Using the manipulated price data and now high-value FTS collateral, the attacker was able to drain assets from the platform.  The steps of the attack are clearly laid out, including funding, manipulating prices, and draining assets. There is enough technical detail provided to determine how the attack was executed through the oracle and governance weaknesses."
furucombo-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in how Furucombo's proxy contract interacted with other DeFi protocols like Aave. Specifically:  - Furucombo's proxy contract allowed users to specify ""handlers"" (other contracts) that it would delegatecall to. This exposed Furucombo's proxy storage to be modified by these handlers.  - One of the allowed handlers was the Aave protocol's proxy contract. This contract had a function to set its own implementation address that is delegatecalled.  - The attacker created a malicious contract and used it to set the implementation address stored in Furucombo's proxy to point to their exploit contract instead of the real Aave contract.  - When users later interacted with Furucombo, it would delegatecall to the Aave proxy contract, which would then delegatecall to the attacker's exploit contract instead of the real Aave due to the changed implementation address.  - The exploit contract was then able to steal funds that users had approved for the Furucombo proxy to access.  So in summary, the vulnerability was:  1. Furucombo's proxy allowed unchecked write access to its storage via delegatecalls to whitelisted handlers 2. One of those handlers (Aave) had a function to write to its own storage that was exposed via delegatecall 3. The attacker abused this to hijack control flow and steal funds  By allowing such broad delegatecall capabilities to a whitelisted set of contracts, Furucombo effectively gave up control of the security of their proxy contract if any of those whitelisted contracts were vulnerable."
gamma-strategies-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Gamma Strategies' configuration of price change thresholds for some liquidity pools. Specifically:  - Gamma had configured high price change thresholds (50-200%) for certain stablecoin/LST vaults. This allowed significant manipulation of asset prices within those pools.  - The attacker used flash loans to manipulate asset prices upwards within affected pools. By pushing prices up near the higher thresholds, the attacker was able to mint a disproportionately high number of LP tokens relative to the assets deposited.  - The attacker then withdrew the inflated LP tokens to drain funds from the protocol.  So in summary, the vulnerability was improper configuration of price boundaries for some pools, which the attacker exploited using flash loan driven price manipulation to mint excess LP tokens and extract funds. The write-up indicates this occurred during the deposit process into affected vaults/pools.  The provided information seems sufficient to understand the core attack vector. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
grim-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a reentrancy vulnerability in the Grim Finance protocol's depositFor() function. Specifically:  - The depositFor() function was not protected against reentrancy. This allowed the attacker to call the function recursively.  - The attacker called depositFor() with their own malicious token contract that contained logic to recursively call depositFor() again on each invocation.  - On each recursive call, the amount of GB tokens minted for the attacker was multiplied, allowing them to mint far more tokens than they should have been able to.  - After recursively calling depositFor() many times, the attacker ended up holding a huge amount of GB tokens. They then withdrew those tokens to drain value from the protocol.  The key elements allowing this attack were:  - Unprotected reentrancy vulnerability in a function that mints tokens - Attacker contract that exploits this by recursively calling the function - Token minting logic that multiplied on each call  So in summary, the attacker exploited an unprotected reentrancy flaw in Grim Finance's depositFor() function to recursively mint vastly more tokens than they deposited, draining value from the protocol. The provided information clearly lays out how the attack took place."
gymnet-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a lack of caller verification in the updated Single Pool Contract introduced by Gym Network.  Specifically, the ""Claim and Pool"" feature did not properly verify the caller of the function, allowing the attacker to artificially inflate their balance without actually depositing any funds. The attacker was then able to withdraw this falsely credited balance, effectively stealing funds from the protocol.  The example exploit transaction shows the attacker calling a function in the vulnerable contract to falsely increase their balance. PeckShield confirms that the issue was due to missing caller verification that would have prevented this attack.  In summary, the attacker exploited a logic vulnerability in newly introduced code that allowed them to trick the contract into thinking they had deposited funds without actually spending anything. This demonstrates the risks involved when making changes to previously audited contracts."
hack-epidemic,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there are not enough technical details provided in the text to determine exactly how the attacks were carried out.  The text mentions that the attacks on Cheese Bank and Origin Protocol involved:  - Flash loans - Fake tokens - Re-entrancy  However, it does not provide specifics on how these elements were combined and exploited to steal funds.  Some possibilities based on the limited information:  - The attackers took out flash loans, used the borrowed funds to manipulate token prices or protocol states in some way, and then stole money before repaying the flash loans.  - Fake tokens were minted and deposited as collateral to borrow assets from the protocol.  - Re-entrancy was used to repeatedly call contract functions before state was updated properly.  But without more technical specifics on the exact attack vectors, contract vulnerabilities, etc., there is not enough information provided to determine precisely how the attacks took place."
harmony-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to execute this theft was the compromised private keys for two out of the five multisig addresses securing the Harmony bridges.  Specifically, the private keys for the following two addresses were compromised, giving the attacker control of them:  0xf845A7ee8477AD1FB4446651E548901a2635A915  0x812d8622C6F3c45959439e7ede3C580dA06f8f25  Since the Harmony bridges operated on a 2 out of 5 multisig, by gaining control of two of those signing keys, the attacker could unilaterally sign transactions to drain funds from the bridges.  The exact method used to compromise those private keys is not clear from the information provided. Some possibilities speculated are:  - The private keys were stored on hot wallet servers that were compromised by the attacker gaining access. - The keys were compromised through phishing or social engineering attacks on the key holders.  But there are no confirmed details on the specific vulnerability. In summary, the attack took advantage of a 2 out of 5 multisig bridge where the attacker managed to compromise two of the signing keys. This gave them unilateral control to steal funds."
harvest-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the price calculation mechanism used by Harvest Finance for deposits and withdrawals from their liquidity pools. Specifically:  - Harvest Finance was using some custom price index/calculation rather than just using Curve's get_virtual_price(). This custom mechanism was the source of the vulnerability.  - The tolerance check for price deviations between deposits and withdrawals was not high enough. Specifically, there was a 3% slippage tolerance that was too high.  - The attacker took out a USDT flash loan, then used Curve to swap funds and manipulate stablecoin prices.  - They deposited and withdrew from Harvest's yUSDT vault, withdrawing more yUSDT than they deposited due to the price discrepancy.  - They repeated this arbitrage about 32 times to extract millions in profits.  So in summary, the vulnerability stemmed from Harvest's custom deposit/withdrawal price calculation mechanism and the lack of proper safeguards against manipulation. The attacker capitalized on this by using flash loans and Curve to distort prices and profit from deposit/withdrawal arbitrage.  Hope this helps explain the technical details behind the attack vector! Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions."
heco-htx-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attacks on the HECO Chain's Ethereum bridge and the HTX hot wallets were carried out.  The key pieces of information provided are:  - A compromised operator account was used to drain funds from the HECO Chain Ethereum bridge into an attacker's wallet. This indicates the bridge itself may not have had a direct vulnerability, but rather an operator account was compromised in some way.  - HTX hot wallets were directly drained into attacker wallets. This could indicate a vulnerability in the hot wallet systems was exploited to gain access.  However, there are no specifics given on:  - How the operator account was compromised - was their private key exposed? Did the attacker gain access through phishing or other means?  - What vulnerability in the hot wallets, if any, was leveraged to drain the funds.  So unfortunately there is not enough technical detail here to determine the specific vulnerability or attack vector used. More investigation details from the affected parties would be needed to understand how these hacks were perpetrated."
hedera-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the attacker targeted liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs) built on the Hedera network that use Uniswap v2-derived smart contract code ported to the Hedera Token Service (HTS).  Specifically, the write-up states:  ""The attacker targeted accounts used as liquidity pools on multiple DEXs that use Uniswap v2-derived contract code ported over to use the Hedera Token Service (HTS).""  ""Further investigation revealed all hts [Hedera Token Service] tokens were at risk. This allowed the attacker to burn bridged/wrapped tokens, as well as remove LP positions from the affected DEXs.""  So the vulnerability seems to have existed in the Uniswap v2-derived smart contract code running on HTS that exposed liquidity pools to exploitation. This allowed the attacker to steal funds from those pools.  There are no further technical details provided on the specific vulnerability, how the attacker was able to remove liquidity provider funds, or how they were able to burn and steal bridged/wrapped tokens.  So in summary, the attack targeted a vulnerability in Uniswap v2-derived DEX smart contract code on the Hedera Token Service, allowing the theft of liquidity pool funds. But there are no additional specifics provided to determine the precise mechanism used."
hope-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the Hope Finance smart contracts to drain funds from the GenesisRewardPool contract.  Specifically:  1. A fake router contract was deployed.  2. The SwapHelper contract was then updated to use this fake router. This transaction was signed by all 3 owners of the Hope Finance multisig wallet, suggesting they were complicit.  3. The `_swapExactTokensForTokens` variable in the SwapHelper was set to the attacker's wallet address.  4. When `GenesisRewardPool.openTrade()` was called, instead of swapping WETH for USDC as intended, the USDC and WETH were sent directly to the attacker's wallet address.  5. The attacker then bridged the stolen ETH to Ethereum mainnet and deposited it into Tornado Cash.  So in summary, the attack exploited the SwapHelper contract by directing swaps to send funds to the attacker's wallet address instead of performing the token swaps. The involvement of the multisig owners suggests this may have been an inside job or ""rug pull."""
htx-huobi-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no technical details given about how the hack on the HTX (formerly Huobi) exchange was executed.  The key pieces of information are:  - 4999 ETH ($7.9M) was drained from the exchange at 10AM UTC on Sunday - The remaining 633 ETH ($1M) was secured by HTX a bit over 2 hours later - HTX CEO Justin Sun claims the hacker has been identified but provides no proof - Sun also claims HTX has ""real-time monitoring mechanisms"" in place now to prevent further losses  However, there is no description of:  - How the hacker gained access - What vulnerability or weaknesses were exploited - How the funds were able to be drained - Why the monitoring mechanisms were not in place before - Technical details of the real-time monitoring now implemented  Without more specifics on the attack vectors, exploits used, or vulnerabilities present in HTX's systems, there is not enough information provided to determine how the attack took place."
hundred-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the exchange rate calculation between the hWBTC token and WBTC in the Hundred Finance protocol. Specifically:  1. There were two hWBTC tokens, one used by the UI and one that was empty.  2. The attacker obtained a flash loan of 500 WBTC from Aave.  3. The attacker then donated the 500 WBTC to the empty hWBTC contract. This inflated the exchange rate between hWBTC and WBTC.  4. Due to a rounding error in the `redeemUnderlying` function, the attacker was able to redeem their small amount of hWBTC (about 2 wei worth) for a very large amount of WBTC based on the manipulated exchange rate.  5. The attacker then deposited the WBTC back into the hWBTC contract and borrowed a large amount of ETH.  6. The ETH was withdrawn for profit.  In summary, the attack exploited:  - The existence of two hWBTC tokens, one of which could be manipulated - The ability to donate WBTC to manipulate exchange rates - A rounding error in `redeemUnderlying`  By manipulating exchange rates, the attacker was able to redeem a tiny amount of hWBTC for a disproportionately large amount of assets."
hypr-network-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack.  The key details that are missing are:  1. Technical specifics on the vulnerability itself - the writeup mentions it had to do with circumventing a check in the 'finalizeERC20Withdrawal' function due to the 'clearLegacySlot' modifier, but does not provide code snippets or further details.  2. Exact steps for how the attacker exploited this vulnerability - while the transactions related to the hack are linked, there are no specifics on how the attacker managed to bypass the withdrawal check using the contract vulnerability.  3. Version details - the writeup mentions that Hypr used an outdated develop branch that contained a vulnerability that was later patched, but does not specify the affected contract versions.  Without code examples, specifics on how the vulnerability was exploited, and version details, there is not enough technical information provided in the writeup to determine the root cause and exact attack vector used.  The key takeaway seems to be that Hypr deployed contracts containing a critical vulnerability that was present in an outdated codebase they forked from Optimism, and they failed to update their contracts even after a patch was released. This highlights the need for better communication and updating practices when building on forked code. But the writeup lacks the technical specifics to analyze the vulnerability itself."
indexed-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited several vulnerabilities:  1. The delayed update of token weights within the index pools allowed the attacker to manipulate the price/value calculation. By gradually buying up UNI tokens and decreasing UNI's weight, the attacker was able to make the pool value calculation diverge from the actual value.  2. The limits on swap sizes (no more than 1/2 the pool's balance in a token, no more than 1/3 purchase of a token) were presumably intended to limit price impact, but the attacker was able to work within those constraints to still manipulate the price over time.  3. Once the manipulated price was in place, the attacker deposited a relatively small amount of SUSHI tokens into the pool, but received a massively inflated number of index tokens (DEFI5) in return, which they then cashed out for assets in the pool.  The key vulnerabilities were: - Delayed weight updates - Pool value calculation based on extrapolated token prices - Limits intended to prevent manipulation that were still insufficient  The attacker was very patient and deliberate in building up conditions to profit from these vulnerabilities. It does not appear there are any significant missing technical details about how the attack took place."
inverse-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited vulnerabilities in the Inverse Finance lending protocol related to price oracles and liquidity. Specifically:  1. The attacker manipulated the price of the INV token on SushiSwap by swapping a large amount of ETH to INV. This temporarily spiked the INV price due to low liquidity on that trading pair.  2. The Inverse Finance lending protocol uses a TWAP (time-weighted average price) oracle that sources price data from SushiSwap. So the spiked INV price on SushiSwap was reflected in the oracle.  3. The attacker then deposited the manipulated INV as collateral and borrowed almost $16 million worth of assets against it. Essentially putting up $600k worth of INV and borrowing assets worth far more based on the inflated price from the oracle.  4. Once the assets were borrowed, the attacker disappeared with them, leaving the manipulated INV behind as bad debt collateral.  So in summary, the attack exploited:  - Illiquidity allowing price manipulation on SushiSwap - The lending protocol's reliance on a single DEX for price data - Short time windows for the TWAP oracle allowing manipulation  This allowed the attacker to borrow far more assets than their collateral was actually worth. Technical execution was complex, involving flash loans, spam transactions, clean addresses, etc. But the core issues were around liquidity and price oracles."
inverse-rekt2,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack.  The key pieces of information that are missing are:  1. Technical details on how the Inverse Finance oracle works and how prices are calculated. The write-up states that the oracle ""misuses the balances of assets in the pool to directly calculate the LP token price"", but does not provide specifics.  2. Technical specifics on how the attacker was able to manipulate the pricing of the yvcrv3Crypto collateral asset using the flash loaned WBTC. The steps show they made various swaps and deposits, but don't explain how those allowed them to manipulate pricing.  Without an understanding of the Inverse Finance oracle design and specifics on how the attacker's transactions impacted pricing, it's not possible to identify the precise vulnerability.  The best I can determine from the information provided is that there was likely an issue in how the oracle calculated asset prices based on balances in liquidity pools. And the attacker exploited this by using flash loaned funds to rapidly alter those balances right before taking out their DOLA loan. But the exact mechanics are unclear.  In summary, there is not enough technical information provided here to conclusively determine which vulnerability enabled this attack. Please let me know if you have any other details that could help shed more light on how it was carried out."
jaypegs-automart-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there are not enough technical details provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attacker compromised the MISO auction contract.  The key sentence is: ""A developer who had been contracted to work on the MISO auction for _“JayPegs Automart”_ inserted his own wallet address into the contract instead of the **auctionWallet**.""  This indicates that an insider - a developer who had access to and was working on the smart contract code - maliciously modified the contract to direct funds to his own wallet rather than the intended auction wallet.  However, without seeing the actual contract code and specifics on how it was modified, I cannot explain the precise vulnerability or exploit that was used.  The write-up does not provide the necessary level of technical detail about the code, contract, or changes made to determine the specific attack vector. It appears to be intentionally vague, likely because the details were not made public or remain uncertain.  In summary, while an insider attack against the contract is described, there is not enough information provided to determine the specific technique used or vulnerability exploited to carry out the attack. Please let me know if any additional detail becomes available that could shed light on the technical nature of this incident."
jimbo-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a lack of slippage control in the shift() function of the JimboController contract. Specifically:  1. The attacker took a 10k ETH flashloan. 2. Used the flashloaned funds to buy a large amount of JIMBO tokens, heavily increasing JIMBO's price. 3. Deposited some of the overvalued JIMBO into the JimboController contract. This triggered a rebalance via the vulnerable shift() function. 4. The shift() function transferred the contract's WETH back to the pool due to lack of slippage control. 5. The attacker sold the remaining JIMBO back into the pool, draining the WETH liquidity and crashing JIMBO's price.  So in summary, the attack exploited the lack of slippage control in the shift() function to artificially increase JIMBO's price, trigger a advantageous token swap, and then drain funds from the pool."
kannagi-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the main vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute the rug pull was the ability for the MainChef contract to initiate withdrawals on behalf of users. Specifically, this quote indicates the issue:  ""The MainChef address can initiate a withdrawal on behalf of a user by specifying the user's address and an amount to withdraw.""  This allowed the attacker, who likely controlled the MainChef contract, to forcibly withdraw funds from user accounts without their consent.  The audit report called out this centralized capability, but it seems users and endorsers of the protocol overlooked or downplayed this weakness. Ultimately, the attacker was able to exploit this withdrawal functionality to drain funds from the protocol into their own wallet.  The information provides reasonably clear technical details on how the attack was carried out, so there is enough evidence to determine the vulnerability. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
kokomo-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the provided text to conclusively determine how the attack on Kokomo Finance took place.  The key information provided is:  1) The deployer address of KOKO Token (0x41BE) deployed an attack contract cBTC and made some malicious configuration changes like setting reward speed, pausing borrow, and setting a malicious implementation contract.  2) Another address (0x5a2d) approved the cBTC contract to spend wrapped BTC that was deposited.  3) The attacker called a method on the malicious cBTC implementation contract to transfer the wrapped BTC to their own address (0x5C8d).  4) The attacker swapped the stolen wrapped BTC to 141 regular BTC for a profit of around $4 million.  However, there are not enough code or configuration details provided to determine exactly how the changes made by the deployer address allowed the theft of funds. The text mentions ""changes"" and a ""malicious implementation contract"" but does not provide specifics on what those changes or malicious logic was.  So in summary - an attacker manipulated the Kokomo Finance contracts in an undisclosed way to steal user funds, but further details would be needed to determine the precise vulnerability. The provided information points to access/control issues with the deployer address and funds being moved in unauthorized ways, but does not give the specifics of how the attack transactions worked from a technical level."
kronos-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited was unauthorized access to some of Kronos Research's API keys. Specifically:  >""[Kronos] admitted to having suffered an attack via “_unauthorized access of some of our API keys_”  The attacker was then able to use these compromised API keys to drain funds from Kronos Research's accounts on multiple exchanges across both Ethereum and BSC chains.  Over $26 million in assets were taken from accounts on OKX, Binance, BTSE, and Deeocoin exchanges by transferring them directly to the attacker's wallet address or flowing them through Kronos' address first likely due to whitelist restrictions.  The post does not provide full technical details on exactly how the API keys were compromised or how the attacker gained the unauthorized access. But with the access, they were able to initiate withdrawals from the exchange accounts programmatically using the APIs.  So in summary, the core weakness was Kronos' API keys being compromised which allowed the attacker to programmatically drain funds from exchange accounts."
kyberswap-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in KyberSwap Elastic's concentrated liquidity pools. Specifically:  1. The attacker used flash loans to manipulate asset prices and push them into regions of the liquidity pools that had little or no liquidity.  2. By executing extremely precise swaps within these low/no liquidity regions, the attacker was able to trick the smart contracts due to a precision error in the code.  3. This allowed the attacker to artificially increase their liquidity share in the pools through ""double liquidity counting"".  4. Having inflated their share of the pool liquidity, the attacker was then able to drain a significant portion of funds from the pools across multiple chains.  The key vulnerabilities stemmed from the ability to manipulate prices/ticks within the concentrated liquidity pools via flash loans, and the precision error that enabled double liquidity counting. Together, these vulnerabilities allowed the loss of over $48 million across six different blockchains.  The attack does not seem characteristic of the Lazarus hacking group based on the performative messages left by the hacker. While the attacker did send funds to a previous Lazarus victim, this could be an attempt at misdirection. Overall there is not enough evidence to conclusively attribute this attack to Lazarus or any other specific entity."
lastpass-users-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability or weakness that enabled the attacker to steal funds appears to be compromised seed phrases that were stored in LastPass. Specifically:  - LastPass suffered security breaches in August and November 2022, with the November breach compromising encrypted customer vault data containing passwords and other sensitive information.  - The article states that the thefts of crypto funds ""appear to be linked to seed phrases stored in LastPass"". This suggests that the attackers were somehow able to obtain seed phrases for crypto wallets from the LastPass data breach.  - The victims are described as experienced crypto users, making it unlikely their funds were stolen through simple phishing or social engineering. This further points to compromised seed phrases as the root cause.  - The article speculates that either the attackers cracked individual password vaults to obtain seed phrases, or that LastPass has not fully disclosed the extent of the data compromised. In either case, stolen seed phrases enabled the thefts.  In summary, the attackers exploited a weakness in LastPass's security to obtain seed phrases for crypto wallets. With the seed phrases, they were able to easily drain funds from those wallets undetected over time. However, there are still open questions around how exactly the seeds were compromised that LastPass has apparently not clarified publicly."
lcx-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack on LCX.  The key details that are missing are:  1) How the attacker gained access to LCX's private keys in the first place. This is the critical first step that enabled the theft. Some possibilities include:  - A vulnerability in LCX's wallet or infrastructure that allowed key extraction - Phishing attack on an LCX employee to steal keys - Insider compromise at LCX  Without knowing how the keys were compromised, it's impossible to fully analyze the attack vector.  2) Technical details on how the funds were moved out of LCX's wallet. The report states that the funds were moved to the hacker's wallet and Tornado Cash, but does not provide the specific transactions or any other technical information.  So in summary, while the overall impact of the attack is clear ($7.94M stolen), the underlying methodology is not described in a level of detail that would allow a definitive assessment of the specific vulnerability. The key phrase that sums this up is:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place.""  Additional data around the initial access point and the transactions used to drain the funds would be needed to provide a more complete analysis. Please let me know if any other details from the report could aid in further assessing this incident."
levana-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Levana's price oracle mechanism. Specifically:  1. The attacker spammed transactions to prevent oracle price updates from going through, either from users or Levana's infrastructure. This allowed them to take advantage of stale pricing data.  2. They DDoSed Levana's back-end infrastructure that regularly updates the oracle prices. This further exacerbated the stale pricing issue.  3. The attacker tracked the difference (delta) between the stale oracle prices and current market prices.  4. When there was a significant discrepancy, the attacker quickly submitted a single multi-execute transaction that went long/short using the stale oracle price while simultaneously updating the oracle to the actual market price. Since they knew the direction and magnitude of the coming price update, this transaction was guaranteed to be profitable for them.  5. They were able to reliably submit these attack transactions during congestion because they were the source of the congestion and could target specific nodes.  The end result is that the attacker was able to reliably exploit the stale oracle pricing to extract profit from Levana. If additional technical details about the attack process become available, please let me know and I'm happy to provide further analysis. But in summary, this was an intricate oracle manipulation attack combining congestion/DoS techniques with surgical transaction ordering and timing."
level-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to execute their attack was:  **A missing check in the claimMultiple function of the LevelReferralControllerV2 contract that would have prevented referral reward claims from reusing the same epoch.**  Specifically:  - The LevelReferralControllerV2 contract handled referral rewards for Level Finance.  - The claimMultiple function in this contract did not contain a check to prevent referral claims from reusing the same epoch.  - The attacker was able to prepare the attack by creating many referrals and using flash loans to increase their reward tier.  - They then exploited the lack of an epoch reuse check in claimMultiple to repeatedly claim referral rewards for the same epoch, draining 214k LVL tokens worth $1.1M.  So in summary, the specific vulnerability was the lack of an epoch reuse check in the claimMultiple function of the LevelReferralControllerV2 contract."
levyathan-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the main vulnerability or weakness that enabled the attack was:  The Levyathan developers left the private keys to a wallet with minting capability available on Github. Four months later, these keys were used to mint and dump LEV tokens, crashing the price.  The post mortem specifically calls out that the developers made a critical mistake by leaving private keys that grant full control over the LEV token supply publicly accessible on GitHub. The attacker was able to find these keys and use them to mint a large amount of LEV tokens and sell them, draining value from the protocol.  Leaving private keys publicly available in source code is a major security flaw that should never happen, especially for a wallet with minting capabilities. This enabled the attacker to easily compromise the LEV token contract and extract nearly all value from the protocol.  In summary, the attack took place due to negligence on the part of the Levyathan developers in securing critical wallet private keys. No other technical details about the specifics of the attack itself are provided."
lodestar-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this attack was a price manipulation of the plvGLP collateral asset on Lodestar Finance. Specifically:  - Lodestar Finance relied on its own GLPOracle contract to provide pricing for the plvGLP asset, rather than an external oracle like Chainlink.  - The GLPOracle contract did not properly account for the impact of the `donate()` function in the GlpDepositor contract, which allows inflating the assets of the GlpDepositor and thus the price of plvGLP.  - Using flash loans, the attacker was able to manipulate the price of plvGLP reported by the GLPOracle to be artificially high.  - This allowed the attacker to borrow much more funds from Lodestar than they should have been able to based on their plvGLP collateral.  - The attacker then drained the lending pools of ~$6.5M and made away with the profits.  In summary, the core vulnerability was the manipulation of the custom GLPOracle price feed for plvGLP due to not properly accounting for the donate() function's impact. This allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their borrowing power and profit."
madmeerkat-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to determine exactly how the attacker gained access and exploited the vulnerability.  The key facts stated are:  - The MM.finance site experienced a DNS attack where the attacker managed to inject a malicious contract address into the frontend code.  - The attacker ""used a DNS vulnerability to modify the router contract address in our hosted files.""  - This resulted in user transactions being rerouted to the attacker's address.  However, there are no details provided on:  - How the DNS vulnerability was exploited and what specifically it was - How the attacker gained access to modify hosted files - Whether files were modified directly on the server or via another method - What the malicious contract address was and what it did  So while it seems transactions were rerouted due to a modified router contract address, the exact mechanics of how the attacker accomplished this are unclear.  Without more technical details from the post-mortem, there is not enough information provided in this write-up to determine the specifics of how the attack took place. The key phrase that sums this up is: ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."" More details are needed to analyze the vulnerability and exploit method."
mango-markets-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited several vulnerabilities in Mango Markets:  1. Low liquidity and volume of the MNGO token allowed the attacker to easily manipulate the price by taking a large position and countertrading against it from another account. This spiked the price from $0.03 to $0.91.  2. The attacker used the unrealized profit from the pumped up MNGO position as collateral to drain lending pools and borrow assets, leaving Mango Markets with $115M in bad debt.  3. The attacker acquired 32M Mango Markets governance tokens, which gave them a lot of voting power. They used this power to create a proposal demanding a $65M ""bounty"" in return for returning some funds and not pursuing criminal charges.  So in summary, the attack exploited:  - Illiquidity of the MNGO token - Using unrealized P&L as collateral - Centralized governance power of the governance tokens  The write-up indicates the issue was raised months ago but not adequately addressed. There seems to be enough technical detail provided to determine how the attack took place. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
meerkat-finance-bsc-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the upgradeability mechanism used by the Meerkat Finance vault contracts. Specifically:  1. The Meerkat Finance deployer upgraded the vault contracts to a malicious implementation that had a backdoor init() function. This function allowed anyone to set themselves as the vault owner.  2. The attacker called the init() function to make themselves the owner of the vaults.  3. The malicious vault implementation also contained a drain() function that could be called by the vault owner to steal all the funds.  4. The attacker, now set as the vault owner, called the drain() function on both vaults to steal the BUSD and WBNB.  So in summary, the vulnerability was the unrestricted upgradeability of the vault contracts, which allowed the deployer to point them to a malicious implementation and for the attacker to then backdoor their way into ownership and drain the funds.  There are enough technical details provided to determine how the attack took place. The attacker used an upgradeability and access control vulnerability to gain unauthorized access and steal funds from the vaults."
merlin-dex-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attack took place. The key details that are missing are:  1. How the attacker gained access to the Feeto address that had max approvals to drain the liquidity pools. The write-up states this was granted on deployment but does not explain how the attacker obtained or accessed this address.  2. How the backdoor/vulnerability worked from a technical perspective that allowed the attacker to drain funds. The write-up mentions there are claims of an intentional backdoor in the code but does not confirm this or provide any code snippets or specifics on the vulnerability.  3. Exactly what privileges or roles were centralized that CertiK's audit warned about and how the attacker was able to exploit those. The write-up does say that Merlin promised to use a multisig to CertiK but does not confirm if this was actually implemented.  So in summary, while the write-up provides background on the incident itself and the aftermath, there are no technical specifics provided to determine precisely how the attack exploited weaknesses in the code or blockchain logic. Without more code-level detail or specifics on unauthorized account access, the exact vulnerability cannot be pinpointed. Please let me know if any additional attack vectors or vulnerabilities are suspected so I can re-analyze."
merlin2-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the text to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute the second attack against Merlin Labs.  The text mentions that:  - The second attack happened 8 hours after the first attack and resulted in a loss of ~200 ETH - The attack took advantage of a mistake in their new priceCalculator that mispriced only BAND  However, it does not provide any further details on:  - What the priceCalculator contract is, what it does, or how it was implemented - What the specific mistake or vulnerability was that allowed the attacker to misprice BAND - How the attacker was able to exploit this mistake to steal funds  Without more code-level or architectural details on the priceCalculator contract and the nature of the vulnerability, I cannot reliably determine the specific attack vector used. The text makes it clear a mistake was made that enabled stolen funds, but does not provide enough technical information about the smart contract logic or transactions to ascertain how.  Please let me know if you have or can provide any additional technical details about the vulnerability. Otherwise, there is insufficient information here for me to technically explain how this second attack was carried out."
merlin3-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability exploited was related to how Merlin's reward system calculated profits and distributed rewards:  1. Merlin's system rewarded users with MERL tokens based on the performance fees/profits they brought in. Specifically, it rewarded 35 MERL tokens for every BNB in profits.  2. The system calculated profits by converting any received BNB to WBNB. So an increase in the WBNB balance was seen as profit by the system.  3. The attacker realized they could artificially increase the WBNB balance by simply sending BNB directly to the contract. This BNB would also get converted to WBNB upon receipt.  4. So the attacker deposited BNB into the contract. This increased the WBNB balance, which the system saw as profit. The attacker was then able to claim 35 MERL rewards for every BNB they deposited.  In essence, the system failed to validate where BNB/WBNB profits were actually coming from. By blindly rewarding based on WBNB balance changes, it allowed the attacker to game the system by artificially inflating the balance."
merlinlabs-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability utilized by the attacker was the ability to artificially inflate the reward balance of the vault contract by sending it CAKE tokens directly:  The key steps were:  2) Send 180 CAKE to the LINK-BNB Vault contract. (This artificially inflates the vault contract's balance)  3) Call getReward with the deposit to collect rewards based on the contract balance  4) With the large CAKE balance, the contract returns a large reward amount  5) Repeat multiple times to drain significant value  So in summary, the attacker was able to artificially set the vault contract's balance to a high amount by sending CAKE tokens directly to it. This then allowed them to collect inflated rewards repeatedly by calling the getReward function. There was likely inadequate validation of the contract's balance before calculating & dispersing rewards."
meter-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability exploited by the attacker was related to an assumption made in the Meter.io Passport bridge contract regarding wrapped native tokens.  Specifically, the contract assumed that if the bridged token was a wrapped native token like wETH, it did not need to burn or lock the tokens since they were already unwrapped. However, this assumption only held true for one of the deposit methods in the contract (depositEth) which validated the deposit amount, but not for another deposit method that was unguarded.  The attacker noticed this discrepancy and was able to call the unguarded deposit method with an arbitrary (likely very large) amount in the calldata. This amount then got passed to the token handler's deposit method and allowed the attacker to mint a substantial number of tokens and drain reserves.  In summary, the attack took advantage of:  - An incorrect assumption regarding wrapped native tokens in the bridge contract - An unguarded deposit method that did not validate the deposit amount - The ability to pass an arbitrary amount to the token handler's deposit method via the unguarded method  This allowed the attacker to mint tokens and drain reserves. The technical details provided seem sufficient to determine how the attack was carried out."
midas-capital-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this attack was a known ""read-only reentrancy vulnerability"" in the WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token that Midas Capital recently added as a collateral type.  Specifically:  - The WMATIC-stMATIC Curve LP token has a vulnerability where the virtual price of the token can be manipulated if improperly implemented - Midas Capital did not properly account for this vulnerability when adding the WMATIC-stMATIC token as a collateral type - The attacker was able to exploit this by: 1. Manipulating the virtual price of the WMATIC-stMATIC token held as collateral 2. Tricking Midas into overestimating the value of the collateral 3. Borrowing excess assets against this inflated collateral - The attacker then swapped the borrowed assets into MATIC and withdrew them  The key technical elements enabling this attack were:  - Improper implementation of the WMATIC-stMATIC token contract in Midas, leaving it vulnerable to manipulation - The ability for the attacker to manipulate the virtual price of the collateral token - Overestimation of collateral value based on the manipulated price - No checks or reconciliations to prevent over-borrowing against this inflated collateral  In summary, the root cause was a known vulnerability in a newly added collateral type that was not properly accounted for. The attacker exploited this to artificially increase borrowing power and drain funds."
midas-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a rounding error in the interest rate calculation logic of the Midas lending protocol.  Specifically, the article mentions:  ""The exploit was made possible due to a rounding vulnerability in the redeem counter, affecting interest rate calculation (as in April’s [Hundred Finance](https://rekt.news/hundred-rekt2/) incident).""  And shows the following code snippet as an example:  ``` uint256 roundedValue = value.div(100).mul(100); ```  This code is rounding the `value` variable to the nearest hundred. The attacker was somehow able to manipulate this rounding in a way that allowed them to redeem more funds from the lending pool than they should have been able to.  The same vulnerability has affected other protocols like Hundred Finance and Tropykus recently. So it seems to be a known issue that has propagated through copied and forked code in DeFi.  Based on the details provided, this rounding/precision error in the interest calculation logic was the specific vulnerability that enabled the $600k exploit of the Midas protocol. There are enough technical details provided to determine this."
mirror-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the first exploit executed on October 8, 2021 involved repeatedly unlocking collateral deposited against short positions on Mirror Protocol by exploiting a vulnerability in the lock contract. Specifically:  - The lock contract did not contain a duplicate call check for withdrawals. This allowed the attacker to drain funds deposited by other users by calling the unlock_position_funds function for their own position ID multiple times.  - Each call to unlock_position_funds unlocked funds deposited as collateral by other users. By calling it repeatedly, the attacker was able to drain those funds.  The key vulnerabilities were:  1) Lack of duplicate call check in the withdraw function of the lock contract. This allowed an attacker to call it repeatedly.  2) The withdraw function unlocked collateral deposited by other users if provided with the attacker's own position ID. This allowed the attacker to drain those funds.  The attack transaction that exploited this is provided:  08DD2B70F6C2335D966342C20C1E495FD7A8872310B80BAF3450B942F79EBC1F  In summary, the vulnerability was in the lock contract's lack of protection against repeated calls to drain collateral deposited by other users. The attacker exploited this by calling the unlock function repeatedly using their own position ID."
mixin-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the attacker gained access to a database belonging to Mixin Network's cloud service provider that contained private keys of Mixin Network users.  Specifically, the article states:  ""the database of Mixin Network's cloud service provider was attacked by hackers, resulting in the loss of some assets on the mainnet""  and  ""The transactions appear to be simple transfers, which would suggest a leak of Mixin users’ private keys held on the cloud service.""  So the vulnerability was that Mixin Network was storing users' private keys on a centralized database run by a third-party cloud provider. By hacking into this database, the attacker was able to steal the private keys and use them to transfer funds out of user wallets.  The article does not provide full technical details on precisely how the database was compromised, but the key factors were:  1) Private keys were stored centrally rather than in a decentralized manner 2) The centralized database was run by a third-party service provider rather than by Mixin Network itself 3) The service provider's security was breached, enabling access to the private keys  So in summary, the vulnerability was Mixin's reliance on a centralized point of failure to store sensitive user data. This allowed the private keys to be stolen once the third-party database was compromised."
moneyfornothing,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it does not seem there was a specific vulnerability or weakness that was exploited to execute an attack.  The incident describes a Uniswap V3 liquidity provider (LP) making an error by adding a large amount of liquidity at ""a very out-of-range pricepoint."" This created an arb opportunity that was capitalized on by an MEV bot, which was able to remove the excess liquidity for profit.  While the LP made a costly mistake, there are no clear signs of an attack or security compromise based on the details given. The MEV bot seems to have simply taken advantage of the favorable market conditions resulting from the error.  So in summary:  - No specific vulnerability or attack vector is described - An LP made a fat-finger error adding out-of-range liquidity - An MEV bot capitalized on the resultant arb opportunity  But there is no evidence of an intentional attack or hack according to the write-up. I would conclude there is not enough information provided to determine how an attack took place."
monox-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the text to conclusively determine the technical details of how the attack took place.  The key details given are:  - There was a bug in the swapTokenForExactToken code of the Monoswap contract that allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of the MONO token.  - The attacker was able to use the same token for both the tokenIn and tokenOut parameters in the __updateTokenInfo function, creating a loop that pumped the price of MONO with repeated ""swaps"".  - Once the MONO price was inflated, the attacker cashed it out into other tokens in the Single Token Liquidity pools.  However, without seeing the actual contract code or details on the specific vulnerability, I cannot explain the full technical process of how the attack was executed.  The text mentions audits were done by Halborn and Peckshield which missed this bug, but does not provide any further specifics.  In summary, while the high-level attack process is described, there are not enough technical details provided in the text to determine the precise vulnerability or code exploit used to manipulate the token price. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional details to share."
moola-markets-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a price manipulation vulnerability to drain funds from the Moola Market lending protocol. Specifically:  1. The attacker supplied 60k CELO worth ~$180k as collateral to borrow a large amount of the protocol's native token, MOO.  2. Using their remaining CELO, the attacker then pumped the price of MOO on a DEX (Ubeswap).  3. With MOO's price artificially inflated, the attacker's MOO collateral was valued much higher. They likely had their collateral reappraised to reflect this.  4. The attacker then used their inflated collateral to borrow the rest of the assets from the protocol - 8.8M CELO, 765k cEUR, 1.8M MOO, and 644k cUSD - draining its liquidity.  In summary, the attacker was able to exploit the fact that MOO was used as a collateral asset to artificially boost their borrowing power and drain funds. This highlights the risks of using volatile native tokens as collateral.  The write-up provides clear details around the price manipulation strategy used, so there is enough information to determine how the attack took place."
multichain-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there are no definitive details disclosed on exactly how the attacker gained access and was able to drain funds from Multichain.  The article states:  ""While the exact attack vector is still to be determined, the[behaviour](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1677281092116840448) of transactions appear to suggest that an attacker was able to control the addresses directly.""  It then provides some plausible methods for how the attacker may have gained access:  ""Plausible [methods](https://twitter.com/BeosinAlert/status/1677281299860709377) of gaining access include a back-end breach, obtaining private keys via spearphishing or the actions of a malicious insider.""  However, there is no confirmation presented on which, if any, of these methods were actually used.  The article also notes that the funds have not been moved since being drained, potentially indicating the actions of a whitehat hacker rather than a malicious attacker.  So in summary, there is not enough definitive information provided to determine exactly how the attack took place. The key phrase that sums this up is:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place"""
nightmare-ftm,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine how the attacker executed their attack.  The text mentions that ""While it remains unknown precisely how the attacker(s) gained access, the fact that multiple associated addresses were drained in short succession may suggest a compromised password manager, potentially LastPass."" However, this is presented as speculation rather than a confirmed fact.  Other possibilities floated are:  - A ""zero day exploit on crome"" - but the text notes this does not sound plausible - Compromise of a Fantom Foundation employee's accounts/devices  Without more technical details on the nature of the transactions, the specific wallet software/services affected, forensics on the drained addresses, etc., it is difficult to determine the specific vulnerability leveraged.  The key phrase ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place"" applies here. Additional investigation and disclosure of details would be needed to fully understand this incident. Please let me know if you have any other questions!"
nirvana-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a price manipulation vulnerability to profit from Nirvana Finance's treasury. Specifically:  1) The attacker took out a $10M flash loan from Solend.  2) They used the borrowed funds to mint a large amount of ANA tokens from Nirvana Finance. This inflated the price of ANA from ~$8 to ~$24.  3) The attacker then exchanged the overpriced ANA for USDT from Nirvana's treasury, netting themselves around $3.5M profit.  4) They paid back the flash loan while keeping the $3.5M USDT profit.  So in summary, the attacker manipulated the price of ANA by minting a large amount with borrowed funds. They then cashed out at the inflated price to profit from Nirvana's treasury. This appears to be the key vulnerability they exploited - the ability to artificially inflate ANA's price and cash out from the treasury."
nomad-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this incident was:  A faulty upgrade to the Nomad bridge's Replica contract initialized the 0x00 address as a trusted root. This caused all messages to be read as valid by default, bypassing the normal validity checks. The attacker was then able to directly call the process() function to drain funds, without first proving the validity of the message batch. Subsequent attackers were able to simply copy the exploit transaction to also drain funds.  In summary, an upgrade bug allowed attackers to bypass the bridge's message validity checks and freely drain funds by calling process()."
okx-dex-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a compromised private key:  Specifically, the private key for the Proxy Admin account was compromised. The Proxy Admin controls the DEX Proxy contract, which is trusted by the main DEX contract to invoke transfers of user funds.  By compromising the Proxy Admin private key, the attacker was able to upgrade the DEX Proxy contract to a malicious implementation that allowed them to directly drain funds from the DEX contract.  The key steps of the attack were:  1. Attacker compromised the private key for the Proxy Admin account 2. Attacker used the Proxy Admin account to upgrade the DEX Proxy contract 3. The malicious DEX Proxy contract was then able to invoke transfers out of the main DEX contract  So in summary, the root cause was a private key compromise of a trusted account (the Proxy Admin). This allowed the attacker to exploit the trust relationship between the Proxy Admin, DEX Proxy contract, and main DEX contract to steal user funds."
onyx-protocol-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a rounding error in the Compound v2 code that allows an attacker to manipulate empty markets in order to drain liquidity across the protocol.  Specifically, the steps of the attack were:  1. The attacker took a flash loan of PEPE tokens.  2. They swapped the PEPE tokens for oPEPE shares, minting a small number of oPEPE shares.  3. They then donated a large amount of PEPE tokens to the oPEPE lending pool, vastly inflating the price of oPEPE shares.  4. The inflated oPEPE shares were then used as collateral to borrow other assets from Onyx, draining liquidity.  5. The rounding error was exploited to withdraw the donated PEPE tokens.  6. The flash loan was repaid.  This ""empty market attack"" takes advantage of the ability to manipulate token prices in markets with very low liquidity. The fact that Onyx had recently added a market for the PEPE token with likely very low liquidity made them vulnerable.  The key preventative measure highlighted is to ensure lending markets, especially new ones, never have zero total supply of cTokens, to avoid this price manipulation vulnerability."
orbit-bridge-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the attack vector was not conclusively disclosed. The article states:  ""While the hack is initially assumed to be due to compromised keys of signer-addresses on the Orbit’s ETH Vault multisig, the team is yet to disclose the exact nature of the attack vector.""  It mentions some possibilities, like a transaction replay attack similar to an issue identified in a past audit, but ultimately says:  ""NOTE: This article will be updated to include the root cause once an official post-mortem has been published.""  So there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to definitively determine how the attack took place. The article is awaiting an official post-mortem report from Orbit Chain to disclose those details."
orion-protocol-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the Orion Protocol's ExchangeWithAtomic contract. Specifically:  1. The exchange contract was not protected from reentrancy.  2. The attacker took out a flash loan of 284,700 USDT.  3. The attacker then called the doSwapThroughOrionPool function to swap the USDT for the attacker's malicious ATK token and then back to USDT.  4. During the token swap, the ATK token's transfer function called back into the exchange contract's depositAsset function. This reentrancy resulted in the flash loaned USDT being deposited again, doubling the balance.  5. After the swap completed, the attacker's balance was recorded as 5.68 million USDT instead of the original flash loan amount.  6. The attacker withdrew the excess USDT for profit.  In summary, the lack of reentrancy protection allowed the attacker to artificially inflate their balance by recursively calling back into the contract. This vulnerability allowed them to steal $3 million in funds. The technical details provided confirm how the attack took place."
paid-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was an infinite mint capability in the PAID token contract.  Specifically:  - The tweet from @WARONRUGS over a month ago warned users that the contract allowed the minting of an unlimited number of tokens. This indicates there was likely a vulnerability in the token contract that allowed minting arbitrary amounts.  - The attacker minted 59,471,745.571 new PAID tokens before dumping them on Uniswap, extracting over $27 million in value. This supports the notion of an insecure mint capability being exploited.  - The tweet from @n2ckchong pointed out that ownership of a contract was transferred to the attacker 30 mins prior. If this was the token contract, transferring ownership could have enabled the minting.  So in summary, there was likely an access control vulnerability that allowed the attacker to mint infinite tokens and extract their value. The details of how they actually obtained access are not fully clear from the information provided. But the existence of the mint vulnerability, transfer of contract ownership, and subsequent minting of a large amount of tokens points to this being the attack vector."
pancakebunny-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute this attack.  The key details that are missing are:  1. The specific code of the PancakeBunny smart contracts that contained the vulnerability. Without seeing the actual contract code, it's impossible to pinpoint where the weakness existed that allowed the attack.  2. More technical specifics on how the price manipulation using the flash loans worked and how it allowed the attacker to mint so many BUNNY tokens. The write-up gives a high-level overview but lacks the precise implementation details needed to fully understand the attack flow.  3. How the getReward() function was coded and how the attacker was able to abuse it as part of the attack. This seems to be a critical part of the attack but there are no code snippets or explanations of the vulnerability within this function.  So in summary, while the write-up gives a broad overview of the incident, there are simply not enough technical details about the specific smart contract vulnerabilities and how they were exploited to determine the root cause without access to and analysis of the actual contract code itself. Please let me know if any additional attack details can be provided to help identify the specific weakness leveraged."
pancakebunny2-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack.  The post-mortem states that the attacker:  1. Made a small deposit into a Bunny Vault 2. Made a large deposit directly to the MiniChefV2 (SushiSwap) contract 3. Called the withdrawAll function to execute the attack, using the amount deposited in MiniChefV2 as interest.  However, there are no technical details provided on the specific vulnerability in the contracts or protocols that enabled this attack.  Without more code snippets, function details, or specifics on how the deposit/withdraw mechanism was exploited, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability. The post references it as a ""loophole"" but does not elaborate on what that loophole was from a technical perspective.  So in summary:  There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place from a technical point of view. More code-level details would be needed to understand the specific vulnerability.  Please let me know if any additional attack specifics or contract details can be provided. I'm happy to re-analyze with more information."
pickle-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to definitively determine how the attack took place.  The key details that would be needed are:  1) What specifically was the vulnerability in the Pickle Finance contracts that allowed the attacker to create a ""fake"" Pickle Jar and drain funds from the real Pickle Jar? This is not clearly explained.  2) How did the attacker actually exploit this vulnerability at a technical level? What transactions did they send, and how did that allow them to drain the funds?  The write-up mentions that:  - There was no whitelist for which Jars could use the swapping function - The swapExactJarForJar function did not check for ""whitelisted"" jars - The attacker created a fake Pickle Jar and used the swapping function to drain funds  But the specifics of how they created this fake Jar, connected it to the system, and executed the exploit through transactions are not provided.  So in summary, while it seems there was likely some vulnerability in the Pickle Finance contracts related to a lack of whitelists/checks around Jars, the post does not contain enough technical details to determine exactly how the attack flowed and transactions were structured. But I wanted to provide that feedback rather than just saying there is not enough information, in case some parts of the attack vector could be inferred or guessed from the limited info provided. Please let me know if any additional details would be helpful!"
platypus-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Platypus Finance's USP stablecoin solvency check mechanism. Specifically:  1. The attacker took a flash loan of 44M USDC, deposited it into Platypus, and used the resulting LP tokens as collateral to borrow 41.7M USP stablecoins.  2. The emergencyWithdraw() function that is used to withdraw collateral only checked if the user's position was currently solvent, but did not properly account for the effect of borrowed funds. This allowed the attacker to withdraw their deposited collateral while keeping the borrowed USP.  3. The attacker then repaid the flash loan using the withdrawn collateral. The remaining USP was swapped via Platypus pools, draining liquidity from other stables like USDC, USDT, etc.  In summary, the faulty solvency check allowed the withdrawal of collateral without accounting for outstanding borrowings, enabling the attack. The attacker was able to profit by swapping the exploited USP stablecoins for ~$8.5 million in other assets."
platypus-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited price manipulation vulnerabilities in the Platypus protocol to drain funds. Specifically:  1. The attacker took flash loans of assets like WAVAX and sAVAX.  2. They deposited these into Platypus liquidity pools like LP-AVAX and LP-sAVAX. This increased the ""liability"" of these pools.  3. They then swapped sAVAX for WAVAX. This reduced the cash available in the LP-AVAX pool.  4. They withdrew WAVAX from the LP-AVAX pool, draining all available cash. This manipulating slippage calculations.  5. With the manipulated slippage, they were then able to swap and profit.  So in summary, the attacker manipulated prices and slippage calculations using flash loaned assets and withdrawals. This allowed them to swap tokens in the pools profitably and drain funds.  The key vulnerabilities appear to be around the slippage and price manipulation calculations in Platypus. The details provided directly outline how the attack took place step-by-step."
poloniex-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, there is not enough information to conclusively determine how the attacker gained access to Poloniex's funds.  The article notes that exchange hacks often involve ""off-chain attack vectors"" like phishing to gain access to private keys or insider access. However, no specific details are given about the methods used in this case.  The article tracks the movement of funds from Poloniex's wallets to the attacker's wallets, but does not provide information about how the attacker gained access to make these unauthorized withdrawals in the first place.  So in summary:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place.""  The article focuses more on tracking the stolen funds on-chain rather than detailing how access was initially gained to perpetrate the attack. More investigation seems to be required to determine the exact attack vector used against Poloniex."
poly-network-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this incident was a compromised 3-of-4 multisig securing the Poly Network funds.  Specifically, the post states:  ""Almost two years after topping the[leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) with a [complex hack](https://rekt.news/polynetwork-rekt/) of over $600M, this time the losses totalled just $4.4M.  _And the attack was a simple case of a compromised 3-of-4 multisig._""  And later:  ""**In contrast to Poly’s last incident, this time appears to be a far simpler case of compromised keys; three of four multisig signers validated deposit proofs, granting the attacker access to funds.**""  So it seems that 3 out of the 4 keys in a multisig scheme that was used to secure funds were compromised by the attacker, allowing them to access and steal funds by providing valid multisig approvals.  The post does not provide full technical details on exactly how the keys were compromised or the specifics of the multisig setup. But the root cause seems to be inadequate security around the multisig keys. This allowed the attacker to gain control of enough keys to execute valid multisig transactions and steal funds."
polynetwork-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this hack was an issue with Poly Network's cross-chain relay contracts, specifically the EthCrossChainManager contract.  The key points are:  - The EthCrossChainManager contract has the ability to trigger cross-chain transactions by calling the verifyHeaderAndExecuteTx function. This function verifies the transaction is valid and then executes it by calling executeCrossChainTx.  - There is no check in place to prevent executeCrossChainTx from calling sensitive/privileged contracts like the EthCrossChainData contract.  - The attacker realized this and crafted the necessary data and sighash to trick the EthCrossChainManager into calling the putCurEpochConPubKeyBytes function on the EthCrossChainData contract. This allowed them to update the public keys and take control.  - By exploiting the lack of proper permissions and checks around what contracts can be called via these cross-chain functions, the attacker was able to call a privileged function and take control of key parts of the system.  In summary, the issue was insufficient authentication and permission checks on a privileged cross-chain contract function, which the attacker was able to exploit to their benefit. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
popsicle-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a lack of proper fee accounting when liquidity provider (LP) tokens are transferred between different contracts. Specifically:  1. The attacker created 3 contracts - A, B, and C.  2. Contract A deposited tokens into Popsicle Finance's pools and received LP tokens.  3. Contract A transferred the LP tokens to contract B.  4. Contract B called collectFees() which incorrectly updated its token rewards.  5. Contract B transferred the LP tokens to contract C.  6. Contract C called collectFees(), again incorrectly updating its token rewards.  7. By repeating this process of transferring LP tokens between contracts and calling collectFees(), the attacker was able to collect more fees than they were entitled to.  The key pieces of information are:  - ""The hack was due to the lack of proper fee accounting when LP tokens are transferred"" - ""Specifically, the attacker creates three contracts: A, B, and C and repeats in the sequences of: A.deposit(), A.transfer(B), B.collectFees(), B.transfer(C), C.collectFees()""  This allows the attacker to collect fees multiple times for the same LP tokens by transferring them between contracts.  So in summary, the vulnerability was an inaccurate tracking of fees owed when LP tokens were transferred between contracts. This allowed the attacker to collect fees multiple times that they were not entitled to."
punkprotocol-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a missing ""Modifier"" in the initialize() function within the CompoundModel code. Specifically:  The hacker used delegateCall() to replace what should have been the protocol's forgeAddress with their own malicious contract, as a parameter of the CompoundModel's initialize() function.  The lack of an ""initializer"" Modifier meant that the manipulated function was executed despite being associated with an unknown (and in this case malicious) contract.  With the forgeAddress now set to their malicious contract, the attacker was then able to call withdrawToForge, sending the assets controlled by the CompoundModel directly to their wallet.  The key weaknesses were:  1) The missing Modifier in initialize() that allowed it to be called by an unauthorized contract  2) The ability for an unauthorized contract to set itself as the forgeAddress via initialize()  3) The withdrawal functionality not verifying that the forgeAddress was an authorized address  This allowed the attacker to fully compromise the withdrawal process and drain funds."
qubit-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute this attack.  The key details that are missing are:  1. The source code of the relevant Qubit Finance smart contracts that were exploited. Without seeing the actual code, it's impossible to pinpoint the specific vulnerability.  2. More technical specifics on how the attacker was able to deposit 77,162 qXETH without actually locking any ETH on Ethereum. The post-mortem gives a high-level overview but does not provide the implementation details that would show the vulnerability.  3. More information about the audit report referenced. It's mentioned that the cross-chain collateral feature was audited, but without seeing the actual audit to understand what was covered and any issues raised, it's difficult to assess where the process broke down.  The post-mortem hints at some kind of logic vulnerability related to the tokenAddress variable in the QBridgeHandler contract and the safeTransferFrom function. But the exact details are not provided to determine if it was an authentication issue, access control issue, integer overflow, reentrancy, etc.  So in summary, while it seems there was likely a serious smart contract vulnerability that was exploited, there is simply not enough technical information provided here to explain exactly how the attack occurred from a code perspective. Please let me know if any additional details can be provided."
radiant-capital-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it appears the attacker exploited a rounding error vulnerability that exists when new markets are launched on forks of the Aave V2 lending protocol.  Specifically:  - The issue affects newly launched markets, before any deposits have been made, when the totalSupply is 0.  - This allows the attacker to take out a flash loan, manipulate the collateral value due to the rounding error, and profit.  - The Aave protocol previously mitigated this by requiring an initial deposit when creating new markets. However, Radiant Capital's fork of Aave V2 did not include this fix.  - The attacker was prepared and deployed their attack contract just 6 seconds after the new USDC market was activated on Radiant.  So in summary, the attacker exploited the combination of:  1) A rounding error vulnerability 2) An empty market (totalSupply = 0) 3) Lack of initial deposit mitigation  To execute a flash loan attack and steal funds through collateral manipulation.  The write-up provides detailed information on how the attack took place, so there is enough technical information provided."
raft-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability that allowed them to inflate the value of collateral in Raft's system. Specifically:  - The attacker opened positions and provided collateral to mint R stablecoins.  - They then liquidated those positions from another address that held excess ETH, likely obtained via a flash loan. This overvalued the collateral from the liquidated positions.  - With the inflated collateral values, the attacker was able to mint a large amount (6.7M) of new R stablecoins.  - They attempted to dump and sell these stablecoins for a profit, but failed to actually collect the profits due to a bug that sent the ETH to the burn address instead of the attacker's address.  So in summary, the key vulnerability was the ability to artificially inflate collateral values by liquidating positions with value sourced from elsewhere. This allowed the minting of unbacked stablecoins. The technical breakdowns provided in the various Twitter threads linked in the article give more specifics on how this was executed."
rari-capital-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to execute their attack.  The write-up provides a high-level overview of the attacker's actions, but does not give technical details on the specific vulnerability leveraged in the protocols attacked (Alpaca Finance, Alpha Homora, etc.).  Some key pieces of technical information that would be needed to analyze the vulnerability:  - Code snippets of the vulnerable functions/contracts in the protocols attacked - Details on the specific payload/exploit code used to extract funds - More specifics on how the attack interacted with and manipulated the protocol to steal funds  Without those types of low-level technical details, it’s difficult to pinpoint the precise vulnerability. The write-up mentions the attack was “similar to the Evil Pickle Jar” technique, but more specifics would be needed to confirm if it was the exact same vulnerability replicated across chains or something different.  In summary, while the high-level steps of the attack are documented, there is not enough technical information provided here to determine the underlying vulnerability used to facilitate the attack. More code-level specifics would be needed for that analysis."
raydium-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to determine exactly how the attack took place.  The key pieces of information are:  - A private key was compromised that gave authority over certain Raydium pool functions - The attacker used the withdraw_pnl instruction to drain accumulated trading/protocol fees from the pools - The attacker changed the SyncNeedTake parameter to increase expected fees and withdraw more funds  However, the write-up does not provide technical details on:  - How the private key was compromised in the first place - The specific permissions the compromised key had to allow withdrawing funds - How the SyncNeedTake parameter was changed or what impact this had  Without these additional technical specifics, I cannot conclusively determine the full vulnerability or attack vector used. The write-up heavily implies it was due to a compromised private key with pool owner privileges, but does not confirm if this was due to an insider threat or how the key was actually obtained by the attacker.  In summary, while a high-level description of the incident is provided, there are not enough technical details on the root cause or specifics of how the attack was carried out."
remitano-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, it seems the attack vector was a data breach that compromised Remitano's hot wallet private keys:  >""The post explains that upon notification of the breach, they consolidated assets from other hot wallets into secure cold storage addresses, and collaborated with Tether to freeze funds.""  >""A total of 1.9M in USDT was frozen by Tether across the two chains, the remaining funds on Ethereum were swapped to ETH and deposited to an exchange""  This indicates the attackers gained access to the private keys for Remitano's hot wallets, likely through some kind of data breach that exposed the keys. The attackers were then able to sign transactions with the compromised keys to drain funds from the hot wallets.  The write-up does not provide enough technical details to determine exactly how the private keys were compromised or what the data breach entailed. But it's clear the root cause was a data breach that allowed the attackers to steal the private keys and gain control of Remitano's hot wallet funds."
revest-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the Revest Finance ERC1155 minting contract. Here is a summary of how the attack took place:  1. The attacker opened a position with depositAmount=0 and quantities=[2] tokens, so no funds were deposited. This created an FNFT with id=1027.  2. The attacker opened another position with depositAmount=0 and quantities=360,000 tokens, again depositing no funds but receiving 360,000 worthless tokens with fnftId=1028.  3. When the FNFTHandler mint function executed, the attacker re-entered the Revest contract via onERC1155Received. They called depositAdditionalToFNFT with amount=1e18, quantities=1, fnftId=1027. This would normally create a new position with fnftId=1029, but due to the delay in updating fnftId, it overwritten position 1028 instead.  4. This assigned value to the 360,000 tokens with fnftId=1028 owned by the attacker. They withdrew those tokens worth 1e18 * 360,000 after only depositing 1e18 funds.  So in summary, the reentrancy exploit allowed the attacker to deposit additional funds to position 1028 instead of creating position 1029 due to the fnftId not being updated in time. This ascribed huge value to their previously worthless tokens in position 1028 which they proceeded to drain."
ripmevbot,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack against the MEV bot 0xbad.  The text mentions that 0xbad's arbitrage contract code had a flaw that allowed the attacker to get 0xbad to approve all of their WETH to the attacker's contract. But the details of what this flaw was are not provided.  Bertcmiller of Flashbots is quoted as saying: ""0xbad did not properly protect the function that they used to execute the dYdX flashloans."" But no further technical details about this unprotected function or how the attacker was able to exploit it are given.  So in summary, while the text indicates there was a vulnerability in 0xbad's contract code that allowed the attacker to steal its funds, there is not enough technical information provided to determine the specifics of how the attack took place. The key phrase that sums this up is: ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."""
ripmevbot2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to exploit the MEV bot was an unprotected swap function in the bot's code. Specifically:  ""The bot’s code had left a swap function unprotected, which anyone could call. This was exploited to sandwich attack the bot via WETH/WBTC trades on Curve, funded via a $50M flash loan.""  The attacker was able to call the unprotected swap function in the bot's contract. This allowed them to manipulate swaps on Curve pools that the bot was using. By pumping and dumping an asset price (WETH) through these swaps, the attacker was able to profit $2M from the bot.  The key pieces of information showing how the attack worked:  - Unprotected swap function in bot contract: ""A bot was attacked due to the lack of access control of a public function 0xf6ebebbb, which could be exploited to manipulate swaps in Curve pools.""  - Attacker called this function to manipulate WETH price on Curve  - Sandwich attacked the bot by pumping and dumping WETH to profit from the manipulated prices  So in summary, the vulnerability was an unprotected swap function that gave the attacker access to manipulate the bot's trading behavior on Curve. This allowed a sandwich attack that drained $2M from the bot."
rocketswap-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was the RocketSwap team storing private keys on their server, which were then compromised via a brute force attack:  ""A brute force hack of the server was detected, and due to the proxy contract used for the farm contract, there were multiple high-risk permissions that led to the transfer of the farm's assets.""  The attackers were able to steal the private keys and use them to drain RocketSwap's farming contracts.  Storing keys on a server, especially unencrypted, is a major security risk. Private keys should be kept offline and properly secured. A brute force attack was able to compromise these keys.  So in summary, the vulnerability was:  1. Private keys stored unsecured on a server 2. Allowing a brute force attack to obtain the keys 3. Keys then used to drain farming contracts  There appears to be enough detail provided to determine how the attack took place. Let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
roll-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine exactly how the attack on Roll took place.  The write-up speculates about possible attack vectors, stating:  >""Igor Igamberdiev states that this attack was a possible private key compromise or inside job""  However, there are no confirmed details provided about the specific vulnerability or attack method used.  The write-up does make clear that:  - $5.7 million in funds were stolen from Roll's hot wallet - The hacker immediately dumped the stolen social tokens for ETH - There has been no public response or statement from the Roll team about the attack  But without further technical information from the Roll team itself, it is impossible to conclusively state how the attack occurred or what vulnerability was exploited.  The lack of details makes it unclear if this was due to an insider threat, a private key compromise, a smart contract vulnerability, or something else.  So in summary - the write-up does not contain enough specific technical information to determine the exact method used in the attack on Roll. The phrase ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place"" accurately reflects the lack of technical details about the attack vector, vulnerability, or method provided in this incident description."
ronin-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine how the attacker executed their attack.  The text mentions that:  - The Ronin network uses 9 validators in a proof-of-authority model, where 5 out of 9 validators are needed to approve transactions.  - 4 of the validators are operated by Sky Mavis.  - In November 2021, an arrangement was made for the Axie DAO validator to also sign transactions on Sky Mavis' behalf to provide a gas-free RPC node. This whitelist access was never revoked.  - The attacker compromised the Sky Mavis validators in some unspecified way.  - Using the compromised Sky Mavis validators plus the Axie DAO validator (which still had signing privileges), the attacker was able to authorize withdrawals draining 173,600 ETH and 25.5M USDC from the Ronin Bridge contract.  However, there are no technical details provided on exactly how the Sky Mavis validators were compromised. The text states ""the official Community Alert doesn't give details on how the Sky Mavis validators were compromised."" Without knowing how the validators were actually hacked, it's impossible to fully determine the specific vulnerability exploited by the attacker.  So in summary - while the text explains how the attacker was able to leverage the excess signing privileges of the Axie DAO validator to approve fraudulent transactions after compromising the Sky Mavis nodes, it does not contain enough technical information to conclusively ascertain the initial attack vector used to hack the Sky Mavis validators themselves."
saddle-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, there does not seem to be enough information to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack.  The article discusses the launch of Saddle Finance, which is described as a ""heavily funded and promoted project that offered nothing new"" and a ""fork"" of the Curve Finance protocol. It mentions that the Saddle Finance pools were quickly arbitraged after launch, resulting in losses for early liquidity providers.  However, there are no technical details provided on how this arbitrage attack was executed from a smart contract/blockchain perspective. The article focuses more on criticizing the lack of innovation and the promoters of Saddle Finance, rather than analyzing the attack vector itself.  So in summary:  - Saddle Finance was launched as a fork of Curve Finance - Its pools were quickly arbitraged after launch - This resulted in losses for early liquidity providers - But there are no technical specifics provided on how the arbitrage was executed  Without more technical details on the attack flow, transactions, smart contract vulnerabilities exploited, etc., there is not enough information provided in the article to determine how the attack took place."
saddle-finance-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the exploit used a flaw in an old version of Saddle Finance's MetaSwapUtils library, which failed to use a VirtualPrice to calculate the value of LP tokens during metapool swaps.  Specifically:  - The hacker made flash loan assisted swaps between sUSD and saddleUSD-V2 LP tokens in Saddle's sUSDv2 metapool.  - Due to the bug, they were able to manipulate the price of the saddleUSD-V2 LP tokens during the swaps.  - After artificially inflating the value of the LP tokens, they were able to swap them back for more sUSD than they started with.  - Repeating this process allowed them to drain funds from the pool.  Saddle had previously identified and fixed this issue in the current version of MetaSwapUtils after a close call for Synapse protocol. However, the swap calculations were still relying on the old, vulnerable code.  So in summary - the root cause was failure to properly implement an important security fix in the metapool swap calculations, allowing price manipulation due to lack of LP token price validation."
safedollar-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in SafeDollar's reward mechanism to manipulate the accSdoPerShare value. Specifically:  1) The attacker made an initial deposit into one of SafeDollar's Safe Farms to prepare for the attack.  2) SafeDollar was incentivizing the PLX token and charging fees on PLX transfers. However, during withdrawal transactions, these fees were incorrectly deducted from the rewarder balance rather than the user balance.  3) The attacker exploited this by depositing and immediately withdrawing PLX in a loop. Over 101 transactions, this gradually drained the PLX balance from the pool, resulting in the accSdoPerShare value becoming massively inflated.  4) With the rewards system now skewed in the attacker's favor, they claimed the rewards on their initial deposit. This produced an enormous amount of SDO tokens (831 quadrillion), which the attacker immediately sold, crashing the SDO price to $0.  5) Despite owning so many tokens, the attacker could only steal the pool's liquidity - 202k USDC and 46k USDT, for a total of around $248k.  So in summary, the attacker gamed SafeDollar's broken fee and rewards system to produce a huge amount of otherwise worthless tokens, dump them on the market, and steal the collateral - ultimately proving SafeDollar was decidedly not safe."
safemoon-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was that the new Safemoon contract code left the burn() function publicly callable. This allowed anyone to burn SFM tokens from any address. The attacker exploited this by burning a large number of SFM tokens that were held in the SFM:BNB liquidity pool. This caused the price of SFM in the pool to become highly inflated. The attacker then sold SFM tokens (that they already owned) into the skewed pool and drained it of 28k BNB, worth $8.9 million.  The key factors that enabled the attack were:  1) The burn() function being left public instead of restricting access to authorized addresses 2) The attacker having a supply of SFM tokens that they could sell into the manipulated pool 3) The pool containing a significant amount of BNB liquidity that could be drained  The attack took advantage of a coding vulnerability introduced in a contract upgrade. By manipulating token balances, the attacker was able to extract nearly $9 million worth of value from the pool."
sbf-mask-off,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided in the text, there is not enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place that allowed the unauthorized transfer of $477 million from FTX.  The text mentions that the $477 million in unauthorized transfers was potentially due to:  1) A hack by an ""ex-employee"" or malware on an ex-employee's computer  2) Instructions by Bahamian authorities to drain FTX wallets  However, there are no technical details provided on exactly how the unauthorized access occurred in either scenario.  The text also states that the reason behind the removal of the $633 million from FTX on November 12th (of which the $477 million was part of) remains one of the most pressing unanswered questions.  So in summary, while the text speculates on some potential attack vectors like an insider attack or instructions from authorities, there is simply not enough technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness that was exploited to enable the unauthorized transfers. The key phrase that sums this up is:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."""
seneca-protocol-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in Seneca's approval process to drain assets from user wallets. Specifically:  **The attacker constructed malicious calldata parameters to call the transferFrom and transfer functions, allowing them to transfer tokens that users had approved to Seneca's contracts to the attacker's address.**  This was possible because:  - Seneca's contracts had over-privileged approval capabilities that allowed the transfer of any approved tokens. - The contracts could not be paused due to an issue with the pause function implementation - the pause and unpause functions were internal, so there was no way to call them to stop the attack.  The attacker was able to steal undeployed LSTs and over 1.9k ETH by exploiting this approval vulnerability.  The analysis shows the specific transactions and addresses involved in the attack. It also covers Seneca's flawed handling of the situation, including their claims of battle-tested code and lack of responsibility.  Overall, there are sufficient technical details provided to determine precisely how the attack exploited Seneca's approval process and drained assets from user wallets."
shibarium-bridge-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack.  The text discusses issues with the newly launched Shibarium layer 2 solution for Shiba Inu, stating that the chain stopped producing blocks shortly after launch. This prevented withdrawals from being initiated from the layer 2 side.  However, there is no mention of an actual attack or hack. Rather, it seems to imply there were issues with the initial launch and configuration of Shibarium that caused it to stall.  The text states that the bridge contracts hold significant value in ETH and the BONE token, but does not provide specifics on how those funds were compromised or stolen. It hints that the funds may be recoverable since the bridges are proxy contracts.  Later the text says the Shibarium developers claimed the screenshot about lost funds was fake and that ""ALL IS WELL,"" implying any major loss of funds may not have actually happened.  So in summary, while there are suggestions of issues with Shibarium's launch and bridges, there are no technical details provided to determine what specific vulnerability enabled an attack or hack to take place. The text is unclear if any actual attack, theft or major loss event occurred.  Therefore, I cannot conclusively determine from this text alone how an attack took place. More details would be needed to fully analyze the security weakness. But it does highlight risks with newly launched layer 2 solutions like Shibarium. I would state there is not enough information provided to determine how an attack took place. Please let me know if any clarification would be helpful!"
skyward-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was a lack of proper verification of the token_account_ids parameter in the redeem_skyward function. Specifically:  - The redeem_skyward function allows users to redeem their SKYWARD tokens for wNEAR from the treasury - However, the function does not properly verify the token_account_ids parameter - This allowed the attacker to pass their own withdrawal address repeatedly within the transaction to drain the treasury of wNEAR - The attacker called the redeem_skyward function in a loop, draining 1.1M NEAR (worth $3.2M at the time) from the treasury  So in summary, the vulnerability was the lack of input validation on a critical function parameter that allowed the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds. There are enough technical details provided to determine how the attack took place."
snowdog-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the report to conclusively determine how the attack took place. The key aspects that are unclear:  1) The exact mechanism used to set the extremely high initial SDOG price in the new liquidity pool. The report mentions that ""pooled ratios"" determined the $70k price but doesn't provide specifics on how those ratios were established.  2) Whether the ""challengeKey"" added to disrupt bots provided privileged access that allowed the early trades to front-run. The report suggests this is a possibility but doesn't confirm it.  3) If there was actual insider knowledge/participation by the Snowdog/Snowbank team in the profitable early trades. There is suspicion raised but no concrete evidence.  Without knowing these technical details, it's impossible to determine if this was an insider attack that gamed the buyback system, or if it was simply early arbitrage traders taking advantage of the opportunity.  The report lays out reasons to be suspicious, especially around the extremely profitable first two transactions. But more specifics on how those trades were configured and executed would be needed to conclusively analyze the vulnerability. As written, there is not enough technical information provided to determine how the attack took place. Please let me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!"
socket-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this attack was:  The SocketGateway contract added a new route 3 days prior to the exploit without properly validating user input in the swapExtraData parameter. This allowed the attacker to inject a transferFrom call that sent approved tokens from victims' addresses to the attacker's contract.  Specifically, the contract did not consider the case where the caller transfers in 0 WETH, which let the attacker specify other functions in the call while still passing the balance check.  The key details that indicate how the attack took place are:  - Lack of input validation on the newly added contract route's swapExtraData parameter - Attacker able to inject a transferFrom call by sending 0 WETH - Victims had previously approved the SocketGateway contract, allowing their tokens to be transferred out by the injected call  In summary, insufficient input validation on a new contract route added shortly before the incident allowed an arbitrary call injection due to improper assumptions about msg.value, enabling theft from accounts that had granted prior approval to the bridge."
sovryn-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to steal funds from Sovryn was an external call to the callTokensToSend function.  Specifically, the analysis states:  ""The attacker uses the LP to borrow 52,999 side tokens. The closeWithDeposit function is then called to repay the collateral. 26,900 side tokens were swapped for 4.17 RBTCs. Notice that the attacker minted 26,000 side tokens into 22,653 Load Token, while in the closeWithDeposit function, there is no such mint function. Then we found that the attacker used the side tokens to call the attack contract externally, and used the attack contract to call the mint function.""  So in summary:  1. The attacker borrowed side tokens 2. They repaid some collateral to make their attack look legitimate 3. They minted additional load tokens externally by calling the mint function from their attack contract 4. This let them mint more load tokens than they should have been able to 5. They burned these extra load tokens to withdraw more side tokens 6. They repeated this to drain funds  The key vulnerabilities were:  - The ability to externally call the mint function from an attack contract - The tokenPrice function relying on the number of side tokens to calculate load token price, which was not updated properly during the attack  This allowed the attacker to essentially double their borrowed funds and drain the lending pools."
spartan-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability in the liquidity share calculation logic used by the Sparta protocol. Specifically:  1. The protocol's `calcLiquidityShare()` function queried the current balance of assets in the pool, which could be manipulated.  2. The attacker took a flash loan of 10K WBNB.  3. They used the flash loaned WBNB to swap for a large amount of SPARTA tokens through the pool.  4. They deposited the SPARTA + small amount of WBNB into the pool, minting pool tokens.  5. They repeated more swaps of flash loaned WBNB to SPARTA.  6. They transferred all the swapped SPARTA and additional WBNB into the pool, inflating the pool's balances.  7. They burned the pool tokens minted earlier to withdraw assets from the pool. Since the pool balances were inflated, they received more assets back compared to what they deposited.  8. They repeated steps 4-7 multiple times to drain funds from the pool.  9. They returned the original flash loan.  In summary, the vulnerability was in the liquidity share calculation logic that relied on the current manipulable pool balances rather than cached balances at minting time. This allowed the attacker to artificially inflate balances and withdraw more funds than they put in."
stablemagnet-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited an unverified SwapUtils library in the StableMagnet smart contract. Specifically:  1) The StableMagnet smart contract used an external SwapUtils library for core functionality. This library was not verified on-chain.  2) The attacker deployed their own malicious SwapUtils library with the same address (0xE25d05777BB4bD0FD0Ca1297C434e612803eaA9a) but different code.  3) The unverified nature of the library meant the explorers and auditors were looking at the benign code in the source, not what was actually deployed.  4) The malicious library contained code to drain all liquidity pools and transfer tokens from user wallets who had approved StableMagnet allowance. This drained $27 million+ funds.  In summary, the lack of on-chain verification for the critical SwapUtils library allowed the attacker to deploy malicious code masquerading as the legitimate library. This permitted stealing funds from liquidity and user wallets due to the over-privileged nature of the approval allowance users had granted to StableMagnet."
stake-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it appears the attacker compromised the private keys to Stake's hot wallets on Ethereum, Polygon, and BSC blockchains, enabling them to drain funds directly.  Specifically:  - Transactions were simple transfers from Stake's known hot wallet addresses, suggesting their private keys were compromised rather than a smart contract vulnerability being exploited.  - Over $41 million in native tokens and stablecoins were drained from these hot wallets and distributed to attacker addresses.  - Stake's hot wallet addresses show no outgoing transfers for several hours after, indicating withdrawals are currently suspended.  The article suggests funds were centralized into these vulnerable hot wallets ""behind a single set of private keys"", but there are no further technical details provided on precisely how the private keys were compromised.  So in summary, it was likely an operational security failure that allowed the attacker to gain access to and steal/transfer the private keys rather than a technical vulnerability being exploited. But the exact method used to obtain the keys is not detailed with the information provided."
stars-arena-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the second exploit that drained almost $3 million from Stars Arena took advantage of a reentrancy vulnerability in the sellShares() function.  Specifically, the attacker was able to insert a block height as the number of AVAX to send during the sellShares() call. This likely allowed them to extract more funds than intended and drain the contract balance.  The technical details suggest:  - There was a reentrancy vulnerability where the contract state was not updated before sending ETH/tokens - The attacker was able to make a recursive call and pass an invalid parameter (block height instead of amount) - This recursion allowed them to drain almost the entire contract balance  The write-up quotes Beosin saying ""the attacker took advantage of a reentrancy vulnerability to insert a block height as the number of AVAX to send during the sellShares() function."" This confirms the attack vector was reentrancy on the sellShares() function.  In summary, the attacker exploited a reentrancy bug, specifically in the sellShares() function, to drain almost $3 million from the contract. There are enough technical details provided to determine the vector used."
steadefi-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attack was the compromise of the Steadefi deployer address. Specifically:  ""According to Steadefi’s own [announcement](https://twitter.com/steadefi/status/1688638572608552960), the deployer address of the protocol was compromised.""  Since the deployer address owned all the vault contracts, the attacker was able to use their compromised access to transfer ownership of the contracts to themselves:  ""As the deployer was the owner of all of the platform’s vault contracts, the attacker was able to transfer ownership (for example, the USDC vault on Abritrum [in this tx](https://arbiscan.io/tx/0x1e94a17f392c77fd897b4bfb66a1364b5508de6b2a36f3b0227a4a9ca4a657f0)) to their own address.""  After gaining ownership, the attacker was then able to drain funds by taking ""owner-only actions such as allowing any wallet to be able to borrow any available funds from the lending vaults.""  So in summary, the key vulnerability was the ability for the compromised deployer address to transfer ownership of critical contracts to the attacker, enabling the theft of funds. This was due to a successful phishing attack or other compromise of the original deployer address. There are no further technical details provided on exactly how the deployer address was compromised."
sturdy-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a vulnerability allowing them to manipulate the price oracle used by Sturdy Finance. Specifically:  1. The attacker took out a flash loan to manipulate the reported price of the B-stETH-STABLE collateral token.  2. The SturdyOracle price oracle then returned this manipulated price to Sturdy Finance.  3. With the manipulated price, the attacker was likely able to drain collateral from Sturdy Finance or take out undercollateralized loans.  4. The attacker then immediately laundered the $800k in profits through Tornado Cash.  The key pieces enabling this attack were:  - Sturdy Finance's reliance on the SturdyOracle price oracle, which was vulnerable to manipulation - The ability to manipulate the price of the B-stETH-STABLE collateral token using a flash loan - The unpatched reentrancy vulnerability that allowed the attacker to drain funds based on the manipulated price  In summary, the attacker exploited the vulnerable SturdyOracle oracle and a reentrancy bug to manipulate collateral prices and steal funds from Sturdy Finance."
superfluid-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was:  The ability to craft malicious calldata that could inject a fake ""ctx"" context object into the function calls between the Superfluid host contract and the agreement contracts.  Specifically:  1. The Superfluid host contract uses a ""ctx"" context object to maintain state between function calls to different agreement contracts in a transaction.  2. The attacker was able to craft malicious calldata that contained a fake/forged ""ctx"" context object.  3. When the agreement contract decoded the calldata, the ABI decoder took the first (malicious) ""ctx"" variant and ignored the legitimate one that followed.  4. The agreement contracts were not verifying the ""ctx"" using the `ISuperfluid.isCtxValid` check, which compares the ""ctx"" hash to the one stored in the host contract.  5. So the agreement contracts ended up operating on the fake ""ctx"" from the attacker, which could impersonate other accounts and bypass authorization checks.  This allowed the attacker to drain funds from user accounts by impersonating them and closing/transferring their stream balances.  The vulnerability was patched by adding `ISuperfluid.isCtxValid` checks in the agreement contracts before decoding the ""ctx"" data from the host contract."
sushi-yoink-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability stemmed from insufficient validation in the processRoute function of SushiSwap's RouteProcessor2 contract. Specifically:  The processRoute function did not properly validate the Uniswap V3 pool passed to it. An attacker was able to create a fake V3 pool and pass their own malicious contract address instead of a real liquidity pool.  During the uniswapV3SwapCallback function called later, the malicious contract was then able to drain tokens from any address that had approved the RouteProcessor2 contract using the safeTransferFrom function.  So in summary, the insufficient validation of the Uniswap V3 pool parameter in processRoute allowed an attacker to impersonate a pool and trick the router into draining tokens to the attacker's contract during the callback.  The key pieces of evidence supporting this analysis are:  - The comment from 0xfoobar explaining how you can impersonate a V3 pool and trigger a malicious safeTransferFrom. - The more detailed breakdown from ernestognw.eth aligning with this explanation. - The example attack transaction showing this exploit in action.  There appears to be enough technical detail provided to determine the vulnerability and how the attack was carried out. Please let me know if any part of this analysis needs more clarification or expansion."
swaprum-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited the ability of the contract owner to upgrade the reward contract to a malicious version that included a backdoor function called add().  Specifically:  - The project's reward contract was upgraded to a new malicious version that included the add() function.  - The add() function allowed the contract owner/deployer address to steal user funds by draining the underlying liquidity.  - The attacker address (listed as the Swaprum Deployer address) then used the add() function to steal user funds.  - Over 1600 ETH stolen this way was bridged to Ethereum and deposited into Tornado Cash to launder the funds.  The audit by Certik had pointed out centralization risks with the owner having authority over certain aspects. However, the audit report did not explicitly call out the specific risk of the owner upgrading contracts or intentionally stealing funds.  Overall, this incident exploited the centralized upgradeability and control of the contracts to rug user funds. The audit report, while noting centralization risks, did not adequately highlight the potential for an insider exploit."
teamfinance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to drain the funds from Team Finance.  The key details that are missing are:  1) The source code of the vulnerable migrate() function that was exploited. Without seeing the actual code, it's impossible to analyze the specific vulnerability.  2) Details on how the attacker was able to bypass the ""authorized sender check"" mentioned by Peckshield. This seems to be a key part of how the exploit worked but there are no further details provided.  3) More specifics on how the attacker was able to manipulate/skew prices in the migration from Uniswap V2 to V3 pairs. Again, this is called out as allowing the attacker to get ""huge leftover"" funds but the exact mechanism is not explained.  So in summary, while the write-up provides a high-level overview of the incident, there is simply not enough technical information about the inner workings of the vulnerable code or specifics of how the attacker crafted the exploit transactions to determine the root cause vulnerability. Without source code and transaction specifics to analyze, it is difficult to ascertain anything more about the weakness beyond speculation."
templedao-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this hack was an unchecked parameter in the StaxLPStaking contract's migrateStake() function.  Specifically, the migrateStake() function did not validate that the oldStaking parameter passed to it was a valid staking contract. This allowed the attacker to:  1. Create their own malicious contract with the same oldStaking interface.  2. Call the migrateStake() function, specifying an arbitrary deposit amount and their own address to receive the funds.  3. Receive the LP tokens from the StaxLPStaking contract.  4. Swap the stolen LP tokens for ETH.  The key lines from the article summarizing this vulnerability are:  ""The StaxLPStaking contract’s migrateStake() function did not contain any checks that the oldStaking parameter was valid. This meant that anyone could create a contract with the same oldStaking parameter, specifying an arbitrary deposit amount and address to which the funds could be sent.""  By failing to validate a critical parameter, the developers enabled this simple attack that allowed the attacker to drain funds from the protocol. This demonstrates the importance of thoroughly validating any external or untrusted inputs to smart contracts, especially those dealing with financial assets."
the-big-combo,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there are not enough details provided in the text to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness the attackers used to execute their attacks.  The text mentions some high-level aspects of the attacks:  For BT Finance: - The attackers were able to ""manipulate the price, call earn, and withdraw the loot"" to steal $1.5 million  For Growth DeFi: - The attacker forced the staking contract to accept a fake token, then removed $1.3 million in liquidity - The attacker created a fake token, supplied liquidity with it, staked that liquidity, and then removed legitimate liquidity  However, there are no technical details provided on the specific vulnerabilities exploited that allowed the attackers to manipulate prices, force acceptance of fake tokens, etc.  Without more technical information on the affected contracts and transactions, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability or weakness the attackers leveraged. As the prompt suggested, the best response is:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place.""  Please let me know if any additional details can be provided that might shed more light on the specific attack vectors used."
thorchain-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that allowed the attacker to drain funds from THORChain was located in the Ethereum Bifrost bridge code. Specifically:  - The code contained an override loop that was intended only for use in `vaultTransferEvent` transactions. - The attacker was able to wrap the router with their own contract, allowing them to access this override loop. - When sending a transaction with 0 call value and 0 deposit amount, the override loop caused the transaction's `msg.value` (set to 200) to be mistakenly read as the `txvalue()`. - The attacker exploited this in a loop to drain liquidity from the protocol across various assets.  The report states that the fix is to make the override only happen for `vaultTransferEvent` transactions, as intended. The comments in the code warned that it was important to keep this check outside of the loop, but it seems that vulnerability was left open, allowing the attack.  So in summary, the override loop could be improperly accessed and allowed the attacker to drain funds by misrepresenting transaction values. The code had warnings about restricting the override properly, but they were not implemented correctly."
thorchain-rekt2,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack.  The write-up mentions that the attacker targeted the Thorchain Bifrost component through the ETH Router contract, and provides the contract addresses involved. It shows the series of transactions the attacker made, emitting fake deposit events and tricking the router into forwarding ETH to a fake Asgard vault address controlled by the attacker. This allowed the attacker to steal funds.  However, the technical details of how the attacker was able to spoof these fake deposit events and trick the router contract are not provided. The write-up states it was due to ""Lack of proper multi-event handling"" but does not elaborate on the specifics of the vulnerability.  The write-up also mentions a secondary vulnerability due to the use of tx.origin instead of msg.sender in the RUNE token contract, allowing interactions with malicious contracts to steal RUNE. But again, the exact details of how this was exploited are not provided.  So in summary, while the write-up provides some helpful context around the incidents, there is not enough technical information provided to determine the precise vulnerabilities and how they were exploited by the attacker. More details would be needed to explain that."
tornado-gov-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided in the write-up, it seems the main vulnerability the attacker exploited was related to Tornado Cash's governance system. Specifically:  1) The attacker was able to deploy a malicious proposal contract using clever techniques to reset nonces and redeploy at the same address that had already been approved by governance. This allowed them to essentially trick the governance system into approving their malicious contract.  2) The malicious contract then assigned a large number of TORN tokens to addresses the attacker had created earlier. This gave the attacker over 1.2 million votes and full control over Tornado Cash's governance.  3) The attacker was then able to use their control over governance to modify the router contract and gain admin privileges over deployed contracts.  So in summary, the key vulnerabilities were:  - The ability to reset nonces and redeploy contracts to approved addresses - The governance system did not properly safeguard or limit votes - Too much centralization of control to the governance system  The write-up provides excellent technical details on exactly how the exploit flowed. There is enough information provided to determine how the attack took place."
transit-swap-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to drain user funds was due to an issue with the transferFrom() function in Transit Swap's smart contracts. Specifically:  ""Because it is decompiled code, it is a little obscure for readers to understand. We can understand that varg0 is the token address, varg1, varg2 and varg3 are the from, to and amount parameters of the transferFrom function.  0x23b872dd in the figure is transferFrom() function signature of the function. Therefore, the claimTokens function calls the transferFrom function of an address, and the address and function parameters are controllable.""  The key points are:  1) The claimTokens function calls the transferFrom function of an arbitrary address provided by the attacker. This allows the attacker to call the transferFrom function on any token contract.  2) The from, to, and amount parameters of transferFrom are also controlled by the attacker. This allows them to transfer tokens from any user's wallet to their own wallet.  So in summary, the vulnerability stemmed from Transit Swap allowing attacker-controlled input into a transferFrom external call, enabling the draining of funds from user wallets. The unverified, closed-source nature of the contracts exacerbated the issue by preventing security audits that may have caught the vulnerability ahead of exploitation."
treasure-dao-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a logic bug in the Treasure DAO Marketplace's buyItem function. Specifically:  - The buyItem function did not properly validate the input quantity parameter. It allowed a quantity of 0 to be passed in.  - By calling buyItem with a quantity of 0, the attacker was able to ""buy"" NFTs that were listed for sale, without actually paying anything or transferring any tokens.  - This allowed the attacker to essentially steal the NFTs that were listed for sale.  The write-up mentions the simple fix that could have prevented this:  ``` require(_quantity > 0, “Cannot buy zero”); ```  This would validate that the input quantity is greater than 0, preventing the attack vector of buying for a quantity of 0.  So in summary, the attack took advantage of insufficient input validation on the buyItem function's quantity parameter. There is enough detail provided to determine that specific vulnerability."
unibot-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The key details that are missing are:  1. The actual vulnerable code in the Unibot router contract. The writeup shows a diagram of the vulnerable code, but does not include the actual code. Without seeing the code, it's difficult to fully understand the specifics of the vulnerability.  2. Precise details on how the attacker was able to exploit the vulnerability. The writeup speculates that there was a lack of input validation that allowed an arbitrary call, but does not confirm the exact exploit flow.  Some possibilities based on the limited information:  - There was a reentrancy vulnerability that allowed the attacker to make multiple draining transferFrom calls before state was updated.  - There was a way for the attacker to directly invoke the transferFrom function in the router contract to drain tokens from users. This could be due to a lack of input validation, authorization check, or access control issue.  But without the specific contract code or confirmed exploit details, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability leveraged by the attacker. The key phrase that sums this up is:  ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place""  Please let me know if any additional details from the writeup could help further analyze the attack vector. I'm happy to provide another assessment given more specific code snippets or attack confirmations."
unsolved-mystery,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, there does not seem to be enough details to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The article mentions that approximately 8,000 Solana addresses were compromised, with funds being directly transferred from those addresses to the exploiter's addresses. This suggests the private keys of the affected addresses were likely compromised in some way.  Some theories mentioned include:  - A leak in a browser extension or mobile wallet - Mobile malware - An ECDSA nonce reuse issue - A widespread malware attack on GitHub repos - An ""iOS supply chain attack"" affecting users who imported/generated keys on mobile  However, there is no clear evidence provided to confirm any of these theories. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko hints at an iOS supply chain attack, but no specifics are given.  The article states that investigations into the root cause are still ongoing. More details would be needed to conclusively determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector used by the exploiter to compromise so many wallets.  In summary, there is not enough information provided in the article to determine how the attack took place. More technical details on the affected wallets and transactions would be needed."
uranium-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to definitively determine how the attack took place.  The key pieces of information provided are:  1) Uranium Finance copied code from Uniswap v2 for their UraniumPair contracts.  2) They changed some values from 1,000 to 10,000 in two places, but not a third place. Specifically:  ``` - uint public constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 1000; + uint public constant MINIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10000;  - uint public constant MAXIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 1000; + uint public constant MAXIMUM_LIQUIDITY = 10000;  uint public constant price0CumulativeLast = 1000; ```  3) This ""resulted in being able to swap 1 wei of the input token for 98% of the total balance of the output token.""  However, there are no code snippets or further technical details explaining exactly how changing those constant values enabled draining the liquidity pools.  Without more code or specifics on the vulnerability, I cannot confidently determine the exact attack vector. The article hints that it broke the Uniswap constant product formula check before updating balances, but does not show the code where this happened.  In summary, while the article provides some helpful clues, there is simply not enough technical information provided to fully explain the attack flow. Please let me know if you have or find any additional details that could help determine the vulnerability. Otherwise, the best I can say is that changing some constant values in the UraniumPair contracts somehow enabled draining the pools, but the exact mechanism is unclear."
value-defi-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it does not seem there is enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The post mentions that ""Despite their bold claims of security, it appears the Value DeFi team didn’t know that withdrawals could be made not only through the main Bank contract, but also from the Vault contract through Proxy."" This suggests there may have been a vulnerability or oversight in the Value DeFi contracts that allowed the attacker to withdraw funds through an unexpected code path.  However, there are no specific details provided on how the attacker was actually able to exploit this. The post also mentions manipulation occurring at certain steps and a withdrawal using the ""wrong Curve function"" but does not elaborate on what that entailed from a technical standpoint.  So in summary - while there are hints at potential vulnerabilities, there are not enough technical specifics provided to determine conclusively how the attack exploited those vulnerabilities from a code perspective. The key phrase that sums it up is: ""There is not enough information to determine how the attack took place."" More details on the contracts, transactions, and code paths the attacker used would be needed to fully understand the nature of the attack."
value-rekt2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided in the post-mortem analysis, the vulnerability that enabled the exploit was due to a missing line of code in the initialize() function of the affected pool contract:  ``` initialized = true; ```  This line sets a variable to mark that the contract has already been initialized. Without this line, the contract could be re-initialized by anyone, allowing the attacker to set themselves as the owner and take full control.  As the new owner, the attacker called the governanceRecoverUnsupported() function to drain the pool's funds into their own wallet. They were then able to take the pooled assets, convert them to renBTC, and withdraw the Bitcoin to their own address.  So in summary, the attack was made possible due to a ""human error"" in migrating code from an old contract implementation to a new contract. A line to mark the contract as initialized after deployment was omitted, allowing the attacker to re-initialize as the owner to steal assets."
value-rekt3,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker used to execute their attack.  The text mentions that the incident was due to the ""improper use of a complex exponentiation power() function behind the calculation and enforcement of the weighted constant product invariant"", but does not provide specifics on how this power() function was improperly used or what the vulnerability was.  It also states that ""Any pool which did not have its liquidity split 50/50 between assets was exploited"" and that ""Since Uniswap only supports pools with a 50/50 asset ratio, Value DeFi used the Bancor formula for their non-standard pools."" This suggests the issue may have had to do with supporting non-standard, imbalanced liquidity pools, but again no technical details are provided about the vulnerability itself.  Without more code examples or specifics on how the power() function and Bancor formula were implemented and misused, there is not enough information to determine the precise vulnerability the attacker leveraged. The text makes clear an exploit happened due to an improper use of a function for calculating the invariant, but does not contain enough technical information about the nature of that vulnerability or weakness in the contract."
veefinance-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided in the markdown text to conclusively determine the exact vulnerability or weakness the attacker exploited to steal the $34 million from Vee Finance.  The text mentions that the attacker was able to manipulate asset prices that Vee Finance referenced from Pangolin pools by making trades between newly created pairs. This allowed transactions to bypass Vee Finance's slippage checks. However, the specifics of how the attacker was able to create these new trading pairs and manipulate prices are not explained.  The text also notes that Vee Finance did not follow recommendations from audits by SlowMist and Certik, but does not specify what those recommendations were or how they could have prevented this attack.  Without more technical details about the exact attack flow and methods used to manipulate prices and approve fraudulent transactions, I cannot determine the precise vulnerability the attacker exploited. The text provides a high-level description of the incident but lacks the specific technical details needed to conclusively analyze the attack vector.  In summary, while the text describes the broad contours of the incident, there is simply not enough technical information provided to determine the specific vulnerability or weakness exploited by the attacker. More details would be needed to fully analyze the attack flow and methods."
venus-blizz-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the information provided, the vulnerability that the attacker exploited was an inaccurate Chainlink price feed for LUNA that was used by Venus Protocol and Blizz Finance. Specifically:  - The Chainlink price feed for LUNA had a hardcoded minimum price of $0.10. As the actual price of LUNA crashed below $0.10, this price feed remained at $0.10.  - This allowed attackers to buy large amounts of nearly worthless LUNA for the actual market price, but use it as collateral in Venus and Blizz as if it was still worth $0.10.  - So the attackers were able to use this essentially worthless LUNA collateral to borrow funds from Venus and Blizz.  - Blizz Finance in particular was unable to react quickly enough to suspend activity, and its treasury was drained of the $8.3 million in funds that were lent out against the worthless LUNA collateral.  So in summary, the vulnerability was the inaccurate Chainlink LUNA price feed that remained at $0.10 even as the actual price crashed. This allowed attackers to exploit the difference between the real and reported price."
visor-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a lack of proper validation in the vVISR Rewards Contract's deposit() function. Specifically:  ``` Due to a vulnerable _require()_ check in the [vVISR Rewards Contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xc9f27a50f82571c1c8423a42970613b8dbda14ef#code)’s _deposit()_ function, the hacker was able to mint unlimited shares using their own [contract.](https://etherscan.io/address/0x10c509aa9ab291c76c45414e7cdbd375e1d5ace8) ```  The deposit() function was intended to only allow valid vVISR tokens to be deposited, but had a weak require() check that the hacker was able to bypass by calling the function from their own custom contract instead of an EOA (Externally Owned Account).  Specifically, the require() check validated that:  ``` msg.sender == from.Owner() ```  Where ""from"" is the address depositing the vVISR tokens. By creating a contract where the Owner() function simply returned msg.sender, the hacker was able to bypass this check and deposit arbitrary amounts of vVISR tokens that they minted within their contract.  This allowed them to mint 195k fake vVISR tokens in their contract, deposit them into the vVISR Rewards Contract to burn them for real VISR tokens, and steal $8.2 million worth of funds.  The solution would have been a stronger validation in deposit() to verify the vVISR tokens originated from a legitimate source instead of relying on the weak Owner() check."
voltage-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the exploit utilized a reentrancy vulnerability due to the ERC-677 token standard used on the Fuse Network. Specifically:  1. The ERC-677 tokens implemented a `callAfterTransfer()` function that can be abused to make additional transfers before balances are updated.  2. The underlying Compound-like lending protocol code followed an insecure sequence of execution where internal states were updated after an external call rather than before.  3. The attacker was able to: - Deposit ERC-677 wrapped tokens into the lending protocol - Borrow other tokens - When the borrowed tokens were transferred out, the `callAfterTransfer()` function was triggered, allowing the attacker to re-enter the protocol and drain additional funds before balances were updated  4. This allowed the attacker to repeatedly drain funds from the lending protocol by exploiting the reentrancy vulnerability.  In summary, the root cause was the combination of the ERC-677 token standard and non-adherence to checks-effects-interactions in the lending protocol's code, allowing a reentrancy attack during the token transfer process."
vulcan-forged-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information provided to determine the exact vulnerability or attack vector used in this incident.  The key details we know are:  - 96 user accounts had their private keys compromised, allowing the attacker to drain wallet contents including PYR tokens, ETH, and MATIC - The funds were initially sent to an Ethereum address and a Polygon address controlled by the attacker - The Vulcan Forged team claims the hacker funds have been traced to a KYC'd exchange address - The Vulcan Forged team uses Venly to provide integrated wallets for user accounts  However, there is no technical detail on how the private keys were actually obtained by the attacker. Possibilities include:  - A vulnerability in Venly's wallet infrastructure that allowed key theft - A server-side breach of Venly or Vulcan Forged that gave access to keys - Client-side malware that stole keys from users' devices - Individual user security failures like phishing that compromised keys  Without more insight into Venly's architecture, Vulcan's integration, or how the keys were taken, it's impossible to determine the specific attack vector. The report is correct that without these details, we can't assign blame or know if it was truly ""compromised keys"". There simply isn't enough information provided to determine how the attack took place. More details from Venly or Vulcan Forged are needed to conduct a proper post-mortem."
warp-finance-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, there does not seem to be enough information to conclusively determine how the attack took place.  The key phrases that indicate a lack of technical details are:  ""The root cause of this incident was the use of AMM-based oracle (Uniswap), which allowed the attacker to manipulate the price of UniswapV2 pair (WETH-DAI) LP token.""  This states the root cause but does not explain the specific vulnerability or how the manipulation occurred.  ""An interesting point to note is that the attacker does not profit from this immediately.""  This suggests the attack outcome is still uncertain or ongoing. More details would be needed to fully understand it.  ""Though this incident leads to ~$7.8 million loss, the attacker does not immediately benefit from it.""  Same as above - the end result for the attacker is still unclear.  The write-up focuses more on commentary about the state of DeFi and speculation about attacker motives rather than technical details of exactly how the attack was executed from start to finish.  In summary, while it provides some helpful context, there is not enough specific technical information provided to determine conclusively how the attack took place. Please let me know if any additional details can be provided."
wintermute-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the attacker exploited the fact that Wintermute had provided the address of their multisig wallet on Ethereum as the destination address on Optimism, but did not actually control that address on Optimism. Specifically:  1. Wintermute provided the address 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 on Optimism to receive OP tokens, but this was actually the address of their multisig wallet on Ethereum which they did not control on Optimism.  2. The attacker realized the address on Optimism was not owned by anyone and they could deploy a contract to that address by brute forcing the proxy contract creation until the nonce matched the original proxy contract creation on Ethereum.  3. The attacker funded an address on Optimism and deployed batches of Gnosis safe proxy contracts using a ProxyFactory contract they adapted until they got a proxy contract deployment at the desired 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 address on Optimism.  4. By deploying a proxy contract to the unowned 0x4f3a120e72c76c22ae802d129f599bfdbc31cb81 address, the attacker gained control of that address and could access the OP tokens sent there.  In summary, the attacker exploited Wintermute's operational security failure in providing an address they didn't control for receiving funds. The attacker realized this address was free to claim on Optimism and managed to deploy the necessary proxy contract to gain control of the tokens."
wintermute-rekt-2,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it seems the vulnerability that enabled the attacker to execute this hack was a weakness in the Profanity tool used to generate vanity addresses for Wintermute's hot wallet and DeFi vault contract. Specifically:  - Profanity was found to have a vulnerability that compromised the security of vanity addresses it generated. This was disclosed publicly in the past week.  - Wintermute's hot wallet and DeFi vault contract both used Profanity-generated vanity addresses, likely to save on gas fees.  - The private key for the hot wallet was probably compromised due to the Profanity vulnerability.  - The hacker then used the compromised private key to drain funds from the DeFi vault contract, which had authorized the hot wallet as an admin. So the contracts worked as intended, but the hot wallet admin key was compromised.  - Wintermute had apparently realized the addresses were vulnerable when the Profanity issue was disclosed, as they moved ETH out of the hot wallet. But they failed to remove it as an authorized admin on their DeFi vault.  So in summary, the specific vulnerability was the weak vanity address generation in Profanity, which Wintermute relied on for their hot wallet and vault contract. This allowed the hacker to compromise the hot wallet private key and then drain the vault."
wormhole-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough information in the write-up to conclusively determine the full technical details of how the Wormhole exploit was carried out.  However, the write-up does provide some high-level details:  1. The attacker was able to bypass Wormhole's ""guardians"" that are designed to verify transfers between chains. This was done by reusing a SignatureSet from a previous transaction.  2. There was a discrepancy between the solana_program library Wormhole was using and the actual precompiled sysvar::instructions on Solana. This allowed the attacker to provide an address with 0.1 ETH instead of the full 120k ETH.  3. The attacker was then able to fake the SignatureSet, call the complete_wrapped function, and mint 120k wrapped ETH (wETH) on Solana that was not truly backed on Ethereum.  4. 93,750 ETH worth of the fraudulently minted wETH was bridged back to Ethereum. The rest was liquidated into USDC and SOL on Solana.  So in summary, the core vulnerability seems to have involved a way to bypass/fake Wormhole's cross-chain verification mechanisms by reusing and manipulating existing transactions and signatures. But without more technical specifics on the transactions and contracts involved, it's difficult to explain the full attack flow. The write-up acknowledges that more details are still forthcoming in Wormhole's incident report."
xtoken-rekt,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided in the write-up to conclusively determine how the attack was executed.  The key pieces of information provided are:  - The attacker used a flash loan from DyDx for 61,833 ETH (~$267M) - They used a private transaction facilitated by Flashbots MEV - They were somehow able to mint a massive amount of xSNXa tokens for a very small amount of ETH - They swapped tokens in various DEXes (Uniswap, SushiSwap, Balancer) to extract value - In total around $24 million was drained from the xSNXa and xBNTa pools  However, the exact vulnerability or sequence of transactions that allowed them to mint so many xTokens is not shown.  The write-up speculates that there may have been a price oracle manipulation due to buying/selling tokens on DEXes like Uniswap. But without the specific transactions, it's impossible to say for sure.  So in summary - there is not enough information provided in this write-up to conclusively determine the exact vulnerability utilized in the attack. More specific transaction data and details on the minting process would be needed."
xtoken-rekt-x2,SUCCESS," Unfortunately, there is not enough technical information provided to determine exactly how the attack took place.  The key details that are provided are:  1) The attacker used a flash loan to obtain a large amount of ETH.  2) The attacker then borrowed a large amount of SNX tokens from Aave and Bancor.  3) The attacker swapped the borrowed SNX tokens for USDC, which lowered the price of SNX significantly.  4) The attacker then took advantage of the lower SNX price to repay sUSD debts in the xSNXAdmin contract and unlock SNX tokens, extracting their value.  5) This was made possible by the xSNXAdmin contract having an erroneous require statement that allowed the callFunction function to be called by anyone, not just the intended dydx SoloMargin contract.  So in summary, the core vulnerability was the erroneous require statement in the xSNXAdmin contract that allowed the attacker to exploit the contract's logic and extract value. But beyond that, there are not enough technical specifics provided to determine the exact sequence of transactions/calls that enabled the attack."
yearn-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, it appears the attacker exploited the fact that the withdrawal fee had been turned off in the Yearn DAI v1 vault during a migration. This allowed the attacker to repeatedly:  1. Take flash loans of ETH 2. Use the ETH as collateral to borrow large amounts of stablecoins from Compound 3. Deposit some stablecoins into the Curve 3pool to mint 3CRV tokens 4. Withdraw other stablecoins from the Yearn yDAI vault for free due to the disabled withdrawal fee 5. Deposit the withdrawn stablecoins back into the Curve 3pool to mint more 3CRV 6. Repeat this arbitrage to accumulate more 3CRV tokens 7. Repay the flash loans 8. Swap the 3CRV for profit  So in summary, the lack of withdrawal fees during the migration allowed the attacker to efficiently extract value from the yDAI vault. The steps for how the attack was executed are clearly laid out. There is enough detail provided to determine how the attack took place."
yearn2-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the attacker exploited a misconfiguration in the yUSDT token contract deployed by Yearn Finance over 3 years ago. Specifically:  1. The yUSDT token generated yield by investing in a basket of yield-bearing assets, including a USDT position on Fulcrum. However, the contract incorrectly contained the address of Fulcrum's USDC contract instead of the USDT contract.  2. The attacker was able to manipulate the share prices of the assets underlying yUSDT by exploiting this misconfiguration.  3. By manipulating the share prices, the attacker was able to mint a large amount (1.2 quadrillion) of yUSDT tokens using just 10k USDT as collateral.  4. The attacker then swapped the minted yUSDT for other stablecoins totaling $11.4 million.  In summary, the vulnerability was a misconfigured contract address in the old yUSDT token contract, which the attacker exploited to manipulate asset share prices and mint a massive number of tokens with little collateral. This allowed them to extract $11.4 million in funds. The analysis provides clear technical details on each step of the attack."
zunami-protocol-rekt,SUCCESS," Based on the details provided, the vulnerability that enabled the attack was a flawed price calculation in the Zunami protocol's totalHoldings function. Specifically:  - The attacker used flash loans to make large token swaps (e.g. with SDT), causing slippage in Zunami's liquidity pools on Curve.  - This slippage allowed the attacker to manipulate the price used to calculate the value of the pool's LP tokens.  - The flawed totalHoldings function enabled the manipulated prices to be used to drain funds from the pools.  The root cause was that the totalHoldings function incorrectly calculated prices in a way that could be exploited via slippage from flash loan token swaps. This allowed the attacker to drain the zETH and UZD pools by manipulating the perceived value of the pool's LP tokens.  In summary, the attack took advantage of a vulnerability in how Zunami's smart contracts calculated LP token prices, enabling manipulation via flash loan driven slippage on Curve."
